Oliver ! the musical is a favorite of mine . The music , the characters , the story . It all just seems perfect . In this rendition of the timeless classic novel turned stage musical , director Carol Reed brings the Broadway hit to life on the movie screen . The transition from musical to movie musical is not an easy one . You have to have the right voices , the right set , the right script , and the right play . All signs point to yes for this play . It almost appears that it was written for the screen ! Our story takes place in jolly old England where a boy named Oliver manages to work his way out of the orphanage . He winds his way through the country to London where he meets up with a group of juvenile delinquents , headed by Dodger , the smart talking , quick handed pick-pocket . The leader of this gang is named Fagin , an older fellow who sells all the stolen goods . But all is not well in London town when Bill Sykes played by Oliver Reed and his loving girlfriend Nancy get tangled up with Oliver , Fagin and his young troops , and the law . What ensues is a marvelous tale of love , affection , and great musical numbers . Whether or not you like musicals or not , one listen to these tunes and you will be humming them all day long . Oliver ! is a triumph on and off the stage and is a timeless work of art .
This is a great film . Touching and strong . The direction is without question breathless . Good work to the team . I feel so sorry for Marlene , By the grace of God go you or I
If there was anything Akira Kurosawa did wrong in making Dodes'ka-den , it was making it with the partnership he formed with the `` four knights '' ( the other three being Kobayaski , Ichikawa , and Konishita ) . They wanted a big blockbuster hit to kick off their partnership , and instead Kurosawa , arguably the head cheese of the group , delivered an abstract , humanist art film with characters living in a decimated slum that had many of its characters face dark tragedies . Had he made it on a more independent basis or went to another studio who knows , but it was because of this , among some other financial and creative woes , that also contributed to his suicide attempt in 1971 . And yet , at the end of the day , as an artist Kurosawa did n't stop delivering what he 's infamous for with his dramas : the strengths of the human spirit in the face of adversity . That its backdrop is a little more unusual than most should n't be ignored , but it 's not at all a fault of Kurosawa 's . The material in Dodes'ka-den is absorbing , but not in ways that one usually finds from the director , and mostly because it is driven by character instead of plot . There 's things that happen to these people , and Kurosawa 's challenge here is to interweave them into a cohesive whole . The character who starts off in the picture , oddly enough ( though thankfully as there 's not much room for him to grow ) , is Rokkuchan , a brain damaged man-child who goes around all day making train sounds ( the 'clickety-clack ' of the title ) , only sometimes stopping to pray for his mother . But then we branch off : there 's the father and son , the latter who scrounges restaurants for food and the former who goes on and on with site-specific descriptions of his dream house ; an older man has the look of death to him , and we learn later on he 's lost a lot more than he 'll tell most people , including a woman who has a past with him ; a shy , quiet woman who works in servitude to her adoptive father ( or uncle , I 'm not sure ) , who rapes her ; and a meek guy in a suit who has a constant facial tick and a big mean wife- to those who are social around . There are also little markers of people around these characters , like two drunks who keep stumbling around every night , like clockwork , putting big demands on their spouses , sometimes ( unintentionally ) swapping them ! And there 's the kind sake salesman on the bike who has a sweet but strange connection with the shy quiet woman . And of course there 's a group of gossiping ladies who squat around a watering hole in the middle of the slum , not having anything too nice to say about anyone unless it 's about something erotic with a guy . First to note with all of this is how Kurosawa sets the picture ; it 's a little post-apocalyptic , looking not of any particular time or place ( that is until in a couple of shots we see modern cars and streets ) . It 's a marginalized society , but the concerns of these people are , however in tragic scope , meant to be deconstructed through dramatic force . Like Bergman , Kurosawa is out to dissect the shattered emotions of people , with one scene in particular when the deathly-looking man who has hollow , sorrowful eyes , sits ripping cloth in silence as a woman goes along with it . Sometimes there 's charm , and even some laughs , to be had with these people . I even enjoyed , maybe ironically , the little moments with Rokkuchan ( specifically with Kurosawa 's cameo as a painter in the street ) , or the awkward silences with the man with the facial tics . But while Kurosawa allows his actors some room to improvise , his camera movements still remain as they 've always been- patient but alert , with wide compositions and claustrophobic shots , painterly visions and faces sometimes with the stylization of a silent drama meant as a weeper . Amid these sometimes bizarre and touching stories , with some of them ( i.e . the father and son in the car ) especially sad , Kurosawa lights his film and designs the color scheme as his first one in Eastmancolor like it 's one of his paintings . Lush , sprawling , spilling at times over the seams but always with some control , this place is not necessarily `` lighter '' ; it 's like the abstract has come full-throttle into the scene , where things look vibrant but are much darker underneath . It 's a brilliant , tricky double-edged sword that allows for the dream-like intonations with such heavy duty drama . With a sweet 'movie ' score Toru Takemitsu ( also responsible for Ran ) , and some excellent performances from the actors , and a few indelible scenes in a whole fantastic career , Dodes'ka-den is in its own way a minor work from the director , but nonetheless near perfect on its own terms , which as with many Kurosawa dramas like Ikiru and Red Beard holds hard truths on the human condition without too much sentimentality .
This was a very well scripted movie . Great fun if you just want a stupid film . Not great production value ( ok , the sound really sucked ) but the performance of Danny Masterson more than makes up for it . Watch this movie and laugh out loud !
The premise is simple . This movies starts out looking like your average lame chick flick about two attractive young people meeting each other in an airport , then things take a 180 degree turn ... I for one , really dislike the kind of mind numbing love story nonsense that pollutes the average movie theater . And it is my humble opinion that Wes Craven , based on his previous meta-horror films ( Sceam ) does too ... Following this logic , it 's not surprising to find that Craven sardonically takes his time to built up a nauseatingly sweet 'sependipity love'-story , only to have an AWESOME Cillian Murphy wreck that whole sugar-coated dreamworld ... The scope of his character Jackson Ripner ( Jack the Ripper , get it ? lame , right ? ) in this film is impressive , he goes from being utterly charming to being a twisted nihilistic sicko , which is a plus in my book . As he proceeds to freak out his victim ( Jennifer Garner lookalike Rachel McAdams , who I found pretty annoying by the way ) , you ca n't help but sympathize with the guy ... This is Wes Craven , embodied in Jackson Ripner , through Cillian Murphy , bashing all brainless chick flicks ... Mr. Craven , I salute you . Best quote : Jackson Ripner ( after beating the snot out of Rachel McAdams in the airplane toilet ) : `` Thanks for the quickie ! ! ! ''
A nicely done thriller with plenty of sex in it . I saw it on late night TV . There are two hardcore stars in it , Lauen Montgomery and Venus . Thankfully , Gabriella Hall has just a small part .
Ten out of ten stars is no exaggeration . This documentary provides the viewers with unique footage about the 2003 coup in Venezuela . This great film is now the minimum knowledge requirement if you want to express a competent opinion about Venezuela or Hugo Chavez . The dramatic , electrified atmosphere , the unique footage will allow you to experience a true historic moment . You 'll feel like you 're in the middle of the situation . The film will help you gain unique insight in the happenings of 2003 and will help you hear a side you will rarely hear on TV . It 's something you should n't miss .
Along with the `` Maratonci trce pocasni krug '' from the same director , one of the masterpieces of ex-Yugoslavia comedies . If you want to understand Serbian mentality , you must see this movie . And if you want to see several of ex-Yugoslav great actors at the same time , this is a opportunity .
*some spoilers* I was pleasantly surprised to find the harsh criticisms ( acting , dated dialogue , unclear storyline ) unfounded . Belafonte is great as a Brandoesque , menacing , swearing spirit who must earn his wings but is realistically ill-equipped from his past life to do so . He learns too late how empty his hustling , materialistic life was without love . Mostel is likewise great as an anguished man with his dying wife Fanny . In spite of his prayers for a miracle , his bitterness prevents him from accepting ( or believing ) in one . The two social worlds the characters represent alternately collide and complement the other , the result being hilarious and touchingly sad . The perplexing ending is actually quite consistent with the rest of the film . After looking everywhere for Belafonte , Mostel looks up to see a falling feather , and he frantically reaches for it as if he 's finally willing to believe in angels and miracles . But Belafonte was n't allowed to finish his miracle ( either to restore Fanny 's health or Mostel 's faith ) , so he never got his wings . The feather floats tauntingly out of Mostel 's grasp , a metaphor for both men 's live : it 's too late and you do n't get a second chance . Like `` It 's a Wonderful life , '' this movie is magical , wonderful , funny , but terribly tragic .
This has to be one of my favourite movies of all time . The dialogue , with the constant use of puns is very tight , the cast are superb , and the plot is highly original . Do n't take my word for it - watch this movie and enjoy it for yourself .
Terry Gilliam 's stunning feature-length adaptation of Chris Marker 's short film LA JETEE is full of mind-bending surprises , yet still touches your heart thanks to the superb cast . Gilliam 's flair for the phantasmagorical works with the script by David and Janet Peoples to play with your head as much as it does with poor James Cole ( Willis at his most Steve McQueen-like -- better than McQueen , even ! ) , a time-traveling convict from the future who literally does n't know whether he 's coming or going as a team of scientists keeps sending him back to the wrong eras while trying to prevent a 1995 plague that 's deadly to humans but harmless to animals . Willis , the justifiably Oscar-nominated Brad Pitt , and Madeline Stowe as a well-meaning psychiatrist give some of the best performances of their careers . Even Paul Buckmaster 's tango-style score is haunting . This one 's a don't-miss !
This film speaks a universal language ; one can relate it to the self , community , society or the wider world . It has a way of not only opening up several questions but also setting one in pursuit of discovering and asking the right questions in order to get to that point of self conviction / ownership . The portrayal of the stereotypes within the film addresses the archetypes around us which must be recognised as being the repeating cycle of destruction , the opposing force of innovation , creativity and growth . The factors which disturb the natural flow of things must be made apparent and tackled . The Idea , is definitely a film to be experienced and not just viewed as it taps into one 's internal voice / conscience through the looking , it makes one feel as opposed to just watch .
Personally , I absolutely love this movie and novel ( I read the book first and decided to see the movie ) . First of all the plot is truly original and one of a kind . The acting is also great and i love the cast . Judd Crandall ( plays Fred Gwynne ) fits his role perfectly and really sells it to you . There are also a few corny lines thrown in there ( Idk if they were meant to be corny ) , but they really will lighten up the mood and provide a good laugh . The Maine atmosphere is really a perfect spot to film this movie and it kind of draws you in throughout the movie . Not only will you love it but you 'll want to see it again and again , I recommend this 100 % to any horror fan ! !
I could write a big enough comment on any one of the characters in Gundam Wing , they could each lead the series with their internal conflicts . Instead we get 8 great leads that take us through 49 golden episodes of Anime bliss . It contains dialogue that you can roll around in your head for months ... years , and then go back to and derive new meaning from , a masterpiece in script writing ( even though it has the typical Anime trait of there being a disparity between subtitles and English dub ) . It has an abundance of concepts and philosophies that make you think about your own views . The relationships between the cold unfeeling males and loving female characters is a stand alone aspect of this series . The relationship between Heero and Relena , and Milliardo and Noin are joys to watch . The apparent rejection of the male is underpinned with an inner turmoil that makes the love ( a word never mentioned in the series ) of the women necessary for them in their harsh soldier environment . The women are chasing aspects of the men that we rarely , if at all see , which makes the leading men all the more enigmatic . It takes Heero all of the 49 episodes to show some caring , but he gets there , and when he does , its a big pay off . And then there 's the giant robot fighting . Fun to watch awesome sequences as good as any Hollywood epic fight scene . Any less clued up person would see giant robot fighting as a silly cartoon function for kids , as has become clear when I 'm trying to recommend this series to my friends , but they 're wrong . Many of the giant robot fights in Gundam Wing contain a hefty dose of pathos , usually concerning young rebels fighting for what they believe in against an oppressive society making their beliefs obsolete . The constant shifts in tone and emphasis through each episode makes Gundam Wing impossible to be boring , it is a captivating , thought provoking study on the potential of the human mind and body .
Fortunately for us Real McCoy fans ( most likely all Baby Boomers who grew-up in the late 50 's and 60 's ) , three of the adult actors/actress appeared when they did for the reunion show , in 2000 . Tony Martinez and Richard Crenna both died shortly thereafter . As enjoyable as it was to see Luke , Sugar-Babe , and Pepino together again , it was equally mysterious about the complete absence of any mention of Lydia Reed and Michael Winkleman ? It is my understanding that Little Luke had passed away in 1999 , but I 'm not sure how . There is no information about Hassie on the internet , that I can find . Very curious why they were not even mentioned ? It was so conspicuous , their absence from the Reunion show , that I suspect that the family of Michael and Lydia herself ( if still alive ) either , 1 ) requested to be left out of the discussion and therefore their desire was granted , or 2 ) TNN could not find any trace of either Michael or Lydia ( like the rest of us ) , they seemed to have vanished . Therefore , it would be the safest policy to leave them out of the conversation all together . Otherwise , the retrospect on Walter Brennen was wonderfully done . They made no bones about it ... it was Grandpa who made the show such a success . I remember , as a child , mimicking Grandpa 's gimp walk and my parents laughing ( as I 'm sure a million other children did back then ) . One annoyance that did bother me a bit , was the tendency for Richard Crenna to dominate the discussion ... at times interrupting Tony and Kathleen to make a point . In fact , although Tony Martinez seemed completely capable to contribute to the conversation , he was not allowed to speak-out and say too much during the Reunion show . Unfortunate , since I wanted to hear from all three , equally . All in all , the Reunion Show was a real treat for me . I 've watched it on DVD several times and have enjoyed it each time .

Many reviews I 've read reveals that most people tend to like Part One better than Part Two . I feel exactly the opposite . Part One played around a bit much with trying to find different ways of showing Che Guevara 's personality through different types of film stock , different locations , and cutting back and forth between an interview and the Cuban revolution . For the most part it was structured finely but somewhat distracting . In Part Two , Che enters Bolivia , and along with changing geographical location , the rules and the structure changes . Gone are the spacial jumps and switching between stocks , the `` documentary realism '' and the treatises . Instead , now we are literally trapped with Che in a desaturated , depopulated landscape where the only people who exist are burdened too far with their lives for anything but survival to be an option . I posit that it 's the dark turn of Che 's life that is the real reason why most people prefer Part One to Part Two . The change in geographic location also signifies , for me at least , that Che : Part One and Che : Part Two are , in fact , the second two acts of a three act structure begun by Motorcycle Diaries . Motorcycle Diaries is Che 's coming-of-age ( or more appropriately , coming-of-ideals ) in Argentina , Che : Part One is his military leadership in Cuba , and Che : Part Two is his downfall in Bolivia . These movies do not completely illustrate his life ( we 're missing his experiences in Guatamala and , more importantly in my opinion , his post-Cuban revolution executions ) , but they create a very detailed exploration into the controversial aspects of his character and nature as worldwide symbol . He both symbolizes the idealism and need for armed resistance to oppression , and revolutionary failings in the post-World War II third world countries and their hindering by such activities as , um , the CIAs meddling . But , yet again , all of that is projected on-screen in this case not through long scenes of dialog and speeches , but through a much more intimate , suffering portrayal of Che at the end of his thread and his life . Again , the rules have changed , and in this case it 's hard to tell if there was any chance of success at all . The number of times the camera shows people literally trapped between a rock and a hard place and the desaturated , shaky long takes involves the audience into the narrative of people imprisoned in a hostile landscape , an existential hell , where revolutionary beliefs ultimately end up taking second tier to the desperation of hunted people starving to death . It 's just not that easy of a movie to watch , but it 's very effective . -- PolarisDiB
Busy is so amazing ! I just loved every word she has ever done- freaks and geeks , Dawson 's creek , white chicks , the smokers . after the first time i saw home room i went and got it the next day . i am a big fan of her and she has a lot of fans here in Israel . if someone has n't saw is excellent movie than do n't waist more time and go see it now . i recommend to all of you to see all of her movies . i saw busy in the late night show with Conan and she was so beautiful and cute i just love her ! everybody who saw the movie- in home room she looks very scary but in real life she is so beautiful ! you have to see all her half nude pictures for stuff magazine ( maxim ) she looks so good there ! ~DANIELLE~
Due to the invention of a `` The Domestication Collar '' , flesh-eating zombies are brought under control , and become productive members of society ; however , they perform menial tasks . The servile dead attend to those living in fenced US 1950s-styled small towns , while untamed zombies roam around in `` The Wild Zone '' . In the town of `` Willard '' , pre-teen K'Sun Ray ( as Timmy Robinson ) lives with parents Carrie-Anne Moss and Dylan Baker ( as Helen and Bill Robinson ) . Alas , the Robinsons are the only family on their street who do not own a zombie ; their new neighbors , the Bottoms , have six . So , to keep up , the Robinsons obtain zombie Billy Connolly ( as Fido ) . Unfortunately , Mr. Connolly 's `` Domestication Collar '' is damaged by an old lady 's walker , and he eats her ; then , new and hungry zombies infest the town . Meanwhile , young Ray has grown attached to Connolly ( the boy and his zombie are like TV 's `` Timmy and Lassie '' ) and , the Robinson family find it difficult to cooperate with the controlling `` Zomcom '' authorities . `` Fido '' does n't go far enough into its own intriguing `` Wild Zone '' ; but , it is a colorful , stylish , and amusingly satirical addition to zombie film lore . Ray and the cast perform well , individually ; with nubile zombie Sonja Bennett ( as Tammy ) and owner Tim Blake Nelson ( as Theopolis ) the most memorable pair . Director Andrew Currie and crew , including Rob Gray ( design ) , Jan Kiesser ( photography ) , Don MacDonald ( music ) , and James Willcock ( design ) , deservedly won awards . ******* Fido ( 2006 ) Andrew Currie ~ K'Sun Ray , Carrie-Anne Moss , Billy Connolly , Dylan Baker
This movie is not only the funniest film ever created , it 's the greatest . My hats off to Mr. and Mrs. Zodsworth and the rest of the wacky , wacky cast . Good morning Satan , Want a donut ? See it post haste ! GO SEE IT NOW !
If you need cheering up on a cold weekday evening , this is the film for you ! Excellent script and perfectly cast actors . I especially loved Ray psyching himself up in front of the mirror before gigs - inspired !
I was very fond of this film . It kept me guessing till just before the very end what would happen . One of the better movies about the partition that I have seen . Urmila Matondkar is gorgeous too . This is one of the most personal and down-to-earth films I 've seen on the partition . It 's a little less mainstream than Gadar , and is really an emotional roller coaster where you start out with one opinion of what is going on , and come out completely one the other side . This is n't typical bollywood fare , but rather an art-house type film . The best part of this movie is that it does n't dehumanize one side of the partition conflict when focusing on the story of another . It does n't blame or castigate but rather lets you draw your own conclusions about things .
It sounds a bit awkward to call a film about war and holocaust shocking since many of us will know only too well of the horrors that war and violence brings . By using the adjective 'shocking ' I do not intend to imply that I am surprised about the things told about in this film or that I was formerly unaware of them , it is just that I am very much impressed by the way in which this film shows how crazy and incomprehensibly horrific it is to kill each other off , either with or without a 'reason ' . The first part of the film focuses on Hanna 's successful participation in the Hungarian resistance . Maruschka Detmers would never have won an Oscar for this performance , due to inconsistent directing , but still her acting is solid enough and she has enormous charisma . She is cast very well as Hanna and immediately has our sympathy . Her very beautiful looks help , of course , but that has nothing to do with her being simply a good actress , playing a good part . Certain inconsistencies keep occurring in Hanna 's War . I sometimes get the idea director Menahem Golan ( often despised for The Gianni Versace Murder ) was in a rush and should actually have allowed a few more takes per scene . On the other hand , I am very thankful he made this impressive and thought-provoking film and as I am very positive about it , I think he did a good job . The second half of the film is the most interesting and tragic one . It focuses on Hanna 's suffering ( beware of Donald Pleasence 's scary portrayal of the cruel and sardonic captain Rosza ) and intensely shows the injustice and horror that comes with hate and violence and war . I receive Hanna 's War , especially the second half , as a strong anti-war film and for that alone Golan deserves credit . It is also this second half in which Maruschka Detmer 's talent comes out , creating a character which goes into film history as one of the most speaking , strong and tragic ever portrayed . It is also great to see Ellen Burstyn , whose appearance and acting style always remind me of Romy Schneider , who -had she been alive and cast- would have made a similar effective contribution to Hanna 's War . The tragic impact of the second half and the desperate tension which is sometimes replaced by hopeful prospects and good news lead to a number of final scenes which show something so unexpected , so moving and poetic in its tragedy that it hit me like a bomb and left me in tears . And when I realized once more it was n't even fiction , it all actually happened , I found myself in even more tears . The image of Hanna portrayed by Maruschka Detmers will be in my mind forever .
This , the finest achievement from Georg Wilhelm Pabst 's Social Realism period is based upon a tragedy in early 1906 that claimed the lives of nearly 1100 French miners as a coal dust explosion deep in mines at Courrieres in northern France took place after a fire had smouldered for three weeks , eventually releasing deadly pit gas that brought about the fatalities . Estimable designer Erno Metzner creates stark sets that simulate the tragedy , providing a perception of reality , augmented by matchless sound editing , with the only music being produced by integral orchestras during the beginning and ending portions of a work for which aural effects possess equal importance with the eminent director 's fascinating visual compositions . Pabst 's manner of `` invisible editing '' that segues action from shot to shot through movements of players proves to be smoothly integrated within this landmark film that also showcases sublime cinematography utilizing cameras mounted upon vehicles , enabling the director to shift amid scenes without having a necessity of cutting . Although the work 's cardinal theme relates to Socialist dogma , the unforgettable power of this film is held in its details , born of Pabst 's nonpareil skill at weaving numerous plot lines into a cinema tapestry that stirs one to admiration for German rescue squads of whom their Fatherland is greatly proud while no less despairing of disastrous losses to the families of French victims ; certainly , a seminal triumph fully as stimulating today to a cineaste as it was at the time of its first release .
An absolute classic ! ! The direction is flawless , the acting is just superb . Words fall short for this great work . The most definitive movie on Mumbai Police . This movie has stood the test of times . Om Puri gives a stellar performance , Smita Patil no less . All the actors have done their best and the movie races on thrilling you at every moment . This movie shakes your whole being badly and forces you to rethink about many issues that confront our society . This is the story of a cop ( Om Puri ) who starts out in his career as a honest man but ultimately degenerates into a killer . The first attempt in Bollywood to get behind the scenes and expose the depressing truth about Mumbai cops . Kudos to Nihalani ! ! After this movie a slew of Bollywood movies got released that exposed the criminal-politician-police nexus . Thus this movie was truly a trend setter . This trend dominated the Hindi movie scene for more than a decade . This movie was a moderate box office hit . A must-see for discerning movie fans .
This movie is a great mocumentary . It follows the rap group , NWH , made up of Ice Cold , Tasty Taste and Tone Def through their unique path to gangster rap highs , lows and back to highs . Through trouble with women , egos , cops and whitey , this group gets to the top of the gangster rap world , as this movie goes to the top of mocumentaries . I know everybodies favorite mocumentary is This is Spinal Tap , for very good reason , however I think that if in the right mood , this movie is simply better . The laughs never end , even for someone not into the rap culture . I 'm a white guy , that has no interest in rap music , culture or anything else associated with it , however I love this movie . Rusty Cundeif , who wrote the screenplay , songs and starred in it showed great potential and it is a shame that I have n't seen him since Fear of a Black Hat . However , I have seen him one more time than you have , and is that , that I recommend Fear of a Black Hat to you for quick laughs . Remember , `` Do n't shoot to you see the whites ! ... .of their eyes ? No do n't shoot to you see the whites . '' FYM and enjoy the movie .
Let me make one thing clear .for the most part , the mentality of those who run the show in Hollywood frankly p*sses me right off in general and even more specifically in relation to its treatment of much loved , iconic characters from the pages of comic books . Why ? Well let 's take a typical Hollywood executive board meeting scenario to illustrate shall we .. Executive no.1 'Hey there 's lots of dollars to be gleaned from superhero flicks these days . ' Executive no.2 'Good point , let 's make one with haste then !  We 'll do a lucky dip in a hat and pick out a superhero at random to base a film upon ! ' ( The dip takes place and a famous superheroes name is pulled out ) Executive no.1 'Great ! Now who can we get to play the part ? ' Executive no.2 'Who 's a big box office star at the moment ? ' Executive no.1 '*name of big actor* is the in thing this week . ' Executive no.2 'But does he really suit the role ? I mean he does n't resemble the character whatsoever . ' Executive no.1 'Who cares ? ! He 's a big name ; We 'll make the film with him in it anyway . ' Executive no.2 'You 're quite right ! And besides we 'll fill the entire film so chock full of glitzy special effects to appease the moronic masses that no one will ever question it anyway ! ' The above scenario clearly illustrates one of the reasons I generally loath most modern superhero movies . All style , no substance and simply pathetic casting of the iconic leads . Of course to be equitable , there are exceptions to the above rule ; when Hollywood does get it right  take the casting of the original ( and still easily the best ! ) Superman ; Christopher Reeve and more recently Patrick Stewart and Sir Ian McKellen in the X-Men films . But back to the general negative traits displayed by Hollywood today ..would n't it be wonderful if our studio executives were to ALWAYS choose actors who actually suited the roles ? Well in this less than ideal world , one filmmaker does just this believe it or not , by casting actors based upon their genuine resemblance to their comic book counterparts . His name is Sandy Collora . Sadly ( but typically ) Hollywood has not as of yet allowed Collora to direct a full length film but luckily for us , he has given us tantalizing glimpses of what the finished outcome would likely look like in the form of two ( as of yet ) famous super hero short features . One is the superb Batman : Dead End and the other is this mock trailer for an entirely fictitious film called Worlds Finest . Well , let 's not mince our words here  this is absolutely awesome stuff ! The casting of Mr. Universe winner and male model Michael O'Hearn , ( who looked similarly awesome but was utterly wasted in the lackluster Barbarian ) makes for the most perfect choice to play the iconic man of steel . In fact , in terms of physical resemblance , there has undoubtedly never been a closer approximation to the comic character . Added to this Clark Bartram is back fresh from his splendid portrayal as the Dark Knight in Batman : Dead End ; Again , yet another hugely judicious piece of casting ! What can I say ?  If only this was indeed a real , full length film ! Hollywood studio executives  take note ! THIS is how it should be done ! As a final note , I am once again intrigued by the vastly split reactions this short film has evoked from fans . Tellingly , the most acerbic and vehemently adverse reactions against it clearly come once more ( as similarly with Batman : Dead End ) from a younger , less cinematically experienced audience ; a fact betrayed by their somewhat grammatically primitive rants and liberal usage of base diction . Such an unfortunate state of closed mindedness is indeed a sad phenomenon albeit one that our aforementioned studio executives in Hollywood , will no doubt derive great satisfaction from . After all , these very same misguided individuals are in all probability the exact same sort of CGI addicted , popcorn stuffing imbeciles that revel in the majority of crap that Hollywood churns out by the deluge these days .
John Thaw , of Inspector Morse fame , plays old Tom Oakley in this movie . Tom lives in a tiny English village during 1939 and the start of the Second World War . A bit of a recluse , Tom has not yet recovered from the death of his wife and son while he was serving during the First World War . If you can imagine Inspector Morse old and retired , twice as crochety as when he was a policeman , then you 've got Tom Oakley 's character . Yet this heart of flint is about to melt . London children are evacuated in advance of the blitz . Young William ( Willie ) Beech is billeted with the protesting Tom . Willie is played to good effect by Nick Robinson . This boy is in need of care with a capital C. Behind in school , still wetting the bed , and unable to read are the smallest of his problems . He comes from a horrific background in London , with a mother who can not cope , to put it mildly . Slowly , yet steadily , man and boy warm to each other . Tom discovers again his ability to love and care . And the boy learns to accept this love and caring . See Tom and Willie building a bomb shelter at the end of their garden . See Willie 's joy at what is probably his first ever birthday party thrown by Tom . Not to give away the ending , but Willie is adopted by Tom after much struggle , and the pair begin a new life much richer for their mutual love . In this movie , Thaw and Robinson are following in a long line of movies where man meets boy and develop a mutual love . See the late Dirk Bogarde and Jon Whiteley in `` Spanish Gardener '' . Or Clark Gable and Carlo Angeletti in `` It Started in Naples '' . Or Robert Ulrich and Kenny Vadas in `` Captains Courageous '' . Or Mel Gibson and Nick Stahl in `` Man Without a Face '' . Two points of interest . This is the only appearance of Thaw that I know of where he sings . Only a verse of a hymn , New Jerusalem , but he does sing . Second , young Robinson also starred in a second movie featuring `` Tom '' in the title , `` Tom 's Midnight Garden '' , which is based on a classic children 's novel .
I never saw this movie until I bought the tape last year . I was enthralled and entertained . It has all the elements of what I love to see in a Sci-Fi story , in a book or on the screen . There 's social commentary , speculation , and a good story . There 's something eerie , and amusing , watching a 1936 view of the 'distant future ' of the 60s and 70s . I think it 's a must see , and not only for Sci-Fiers .
I thought that Mr. Dreyfuss was perfect for his role as the actor and the dictator . His co-star , Mr. Julia , played his role equally as perfect . It was interesting to see how reluctant Richard Dreyfuss was in replacing the dictator against his will . But he became more confident and comfortable with the role as time passed . Since everything happens for a reason in life , I believe he was forced to replace the dictator because he was meant to stay there for over the year that he did . I 'm guessing that he stayed because he was supposed to see how good his life was compared to the poverty he witnessed in Parador . I think he took too many things for granted in life and he needed to get a serious reality check by remaining in that country for as long as he did . But ... ... ... .. anyways ... ... ... .. this is why I gave this film a 7 out of 10 .
Something surprised me about this movie - it was actually original . It was not the same old recycled crap that comes out of Hollywood every month . I saw this movie on video because I did not even know about it before I saw it at my local video store . If you see this movie available - rent it - you will not regret it . The suspense builds throughout and the twist ending is excellent .
I saw this movie in sixth grade around Christmas Time , and I was really excited about seeing it , and when I heard that George C. Scott was in it , I was really excited , because I really love George C. Scott ! When me and my class were watching this movie , I was really into it , and when it was over , I was really impressed , I thought that it was totally fabulous ! This is the best version of Charles Dickens ' classic novel that I have seen so far ! George C. Scott 's performance as Scrooge is something else , I thought that he was the perfect choice , he was Scrooge , he is the definitive Scrooge ! I 've seen two different versions of A Christmas Carol , the other is the one with Patrick Stewart , but this is the better one ! What it really great about this is the acting , I thought that the actors were fabulous , everyone was , the spirits , Tiny Tim , Bob Cratchit , everyone , they could not have found anyone better than the ones they had doing the parts ! But the best part of the movie was George C. Scott ! When I saw him , I thought that he was the absolute best ! He is the definitive Ebenezer Scrooge , I do not think that they could have found someone better ! I do n't think that they could have found anyone better to replace anyone in the movie ! This movie is probably the definitive movie adaption of the classic by Charles Dickens , and I really think that you will agree , you will think that this movie is fabulous ! I am probably going to have to buy this movie on DVD , because I thought that it was totally fabulous ! I totally recommend that you see this masterpiece ! This is the best version of A Christmas Carol , period . 10/10
For those of you unfamiliar with Jimmy Stewart , this is one of his `` lesser '' films from later in his career . And , while it is n't a great film compared to many of his other pictures , it is n't bad and is a decent time-passer -- but not much more . Kim Novak is a witch in New York City and for some inexplicable reason , she decides to cast a spell on poor Jimmy to make him fall in love with her . Over time , the cold and detached Ms. Novak also begins to fall in love with Stewart -- and apparently in the witch 's rule book , this is a definite NO , NO ! ! The film is odd in its sensibilities about the witches . They are neither the baby-sacrificing nor the all-powerful variety . Most of their magic is pretty limited and pointless ( such as Jack Lemmon using his powers to turn off street lamps ) . And , very oddly , the witches all seem to be bohemians who hang out in hip bars where you might find people wearing berets and listening to crappy jazz . Considering what I think of jazz , it must really stink to be a witch in this movie 's world ! Anyway , the film is pretty romantic and mildly comedic , but not something I would rush out to watch . The acting is pretty good , but the script does n't offer enough payoff to make this an exceptional film -- in fact , I almost scored the film a 6 -- it was really close .
I typically do n't like reality shows , particularly the ones that are profiting off of `` American Idol '' 's success . But this one I can live with . Comedians from all around the world perform a brief routine for celebrity talent scouts , and if they like them , those guys will be sent to perform a routine for an actual audience . Then ten or twelve comics are selected to live in a house together and do `` Survivor '' style competitions using comedic tactics . Then one will be determined as `` Last Comic Standing . '' I do like stand up comedy , so this is the one reality show must keen to my interests . There are usually some pretty funny comics selected through . It started the careers of such talents as Alonzo Bodden , Ralphie May , and Josh Blue . My negative criticisms is the fact that there is the possibility that a lot of these comics were selected for their contribution to reality show drama . At first they lived together in a house like `` Big Brother , '' but now they 've done away with that , thank God . And there are a lot of comedians I felt , were only chosen not because they 're funny , but because of race , ethnicity , attitude , sex , etc . when other comics clearly should 've beaten them out . But overall , it 's a well-made reality show , which are two terms up until now I thought were an oxymoron .
Each of the major studios cranked out jazzy one-reelers throughout the thirties and forties ( with Universal taking the lead ) . While most looked as cheap on screen as they were to make , Warner Bros. ( which abruptly stopped making them in 1946 ) often distinguished theirs with offbeat camera angles , mirrors and optical effects , thanks to some creative directors like Jean Negulesco . It is fitting that the best of this genre should come from this studio . What sets `` Jammin ' The Blues '' apart from the rest of the pack is that it more closely resembles an avant-garde experiment than a Hollywood musical . Filmed in July 1944 , it transforms an ordinary jam session into a `` trippy '' dream-escape from war-time troubles , highlighted by the tune of `` On The Sunny Side Of The Street '' . Gjon Mili and cameraman Robert Burkes ( later to work with Hitchcock ) were allowed plenty of artistic freedom , perhaps because Lester Young was not Glenn Miller and the studio could care less how he and his fellow musicians were presented . The optical printer is put to good use , with multiple images of the same performer appearing at once . ( Norman McLaren really milked this process two decades later in `` Pas De Deux '' , while Linwood Dunn 's team achieved different effects in `` Citizen Kane '' . ) The strong emphasis on silhouettes and lit cigarette smoke was also ahead of its time ; in some ways , this predated the psychedelic sixties , but with a distinctly forties film noir style .
First it was Jack The Ripper , now it is Alan Feinstone . The crazy dentist tortures people in horrific ways . Quite realistic at times but some of the acting is abysmal and comical . Especially from Corbin Bernson . In some scenes there is dental torture that will really make you cringe .
I liked this movie , ,cute and funny.I found this film to be a good family film.the dirtiest part of this movie was when it made references to the New York Yankees . You have to be in Red Sox nation to understand that NY Yankees is a dirty word.Sorry to say that to the Yankee 's fans.I recommend this picture for the entire family.Of course with your typical love/comedy movie , ,there 's a long moment in the movie , ,with i 'm in love and what do I do , ,but the movie makes up for that with all the slapstick moments.The movie show 's some moments of how the Red Sox nation ( in Fenway Park ) how the fans felt about 86 years of the Sox always screwed up at the end of the season and how the love of the Sox and the love with another human go hand to hand .
Brilliant movie . The drawings were just amazing . Too bad it ended before it begun . I´ve waited 21 years for a sequel , but nooooo ! ! !
Well , it 's yet again a film that plays with your sentiments and you come out all soft as opposed to a rocky film . But I 'm a sucker for those so I gave it a good score ... the acting was very good and there were a lot of feeling . The violence is kept to a minimal which makes a change . I 'd have given it a 9 if it were not for the salute at the end ! All in all a good movie with very good actors .
So many wonderful actresses in one film serve as a practical invitation to the local movie house so I duly responded . Here are some remarks.. Vanessa Redgrave is great even while lying in bed . She also looks very old and I do n't think this is achieved with much make-up which is a good thing for the film but a sad thing for us cinema-goers . I think her aging got a bit harsh in recent years . Claire Danes continues her welcome return to the movies and exudes a definite warmth . Mamie Gummer 's resemblance to her mother Merly Streep both in terms of physical appearance and acting style is so striking that I lost my concentration to the film for a couple of minutes after her entrance . She is surprisingly good ; however such a resemblance has the danger of working against her favor . I agree with a previous comment : Natasha Richardson definitely had some plastic job done to her face . She certainly does not look like how I remember her from previous films ( `` Nell '' for example . ) Both she and Toni Collette sadly do not make much impression partly because they do not look convincing as sisters . Their interplay is weak . Toni Collette additionally is way too old for her character . Glenn Close and Meryl Streep had to have more screen time . Streep 's performance actually is little more than a cameo . Her scenes on the other hand have bigger emotional resonance than the rest of the film . Eileen Atkins provides some welcome dry wit , especially in her second role as an imaginary nighttime companion to Redgrave 's character . As for the men ; Hugh Dancy enlivenes the film considerably even though he gives a broader performance than needed . As a matter of fact as soon as he exits the story it starts to drag . It is also to his credit that he manages to create the exact necessary sense of boyish charm in the viewer . Patrick Wilson on the other hand is a complete void at the center of the film . He also has the misfortune that the script is insufficient in explaining why three people ( one of them a man ) are so much smitten by this man . The backstory to this should have been developed more . The cinematography is excellent as expected . However the main summer house set failed to convince me . It does not look natural on the top of that rocky hill , particularly with its grass patch in the front . A bit too cardboard like . Overall , the film is a classy production , but a seen-it-all-before , cried-at-it-all-before feeling took over me during most of its duration and consequently it failed to make the kind of impact on me that I expected from a tearjerker . However , it still managed to make me thoughtful about the passing of time , about one 's expectations from life and the extent to which these are fulfilled or not . Worth trying at least on DVD if not at the movies ...
I was one of many that expected to see a glorified , Yankee-doodle dandy portrayal of a day that ( as famously quoted ) should live in infamy , rather than glory . How wrong I was . These guys were there , right in the middle of it , and the pictures they returned are both amazing and heartbreaking . And yet it all occurred on a chance trip to the world trade centre on September 11 , 2001 . Two French filmmakers were compiling a documentary about life as a NY firefighter , particularly from the perspective of a young rookie coming up through the ranks . At the beginning we see much of this footage , just to remind us that there was no thought to producing a film about terrorism . This was intended to be a film about regular people earning an honest living helping others , and the beauty of the film is that it never loses this edge . While investigating a suspect gas line ( I think , my memory 's a little hazy on that ) , we suddenly hear a plane fly overhead . The camera pans up to reveal a commercial jet torpedoing itself into one of the towers . What must the cameraman have been thinking at this time ? Recognising the importance of the footage the camera stays on , and possibly realizing the same thing , the FDNY allow the camera to follow them into the building . What follows is a true view from the front-lines . We see the commitment of the FDNY , their reactions ( the stunned silence after hearing the first person fall to their death is chilling ) as well as the collapse of the one of the buildings from the inside , while a second camera captures the events from the outside . If it was n't for the horrific event they were covering , the footage alone would be any young doco-maker 's dream come true . Quite simply , the footage deserves to be preserved for all time . But what really sets this film apart is the genuine humanity that it brings to the viewer . We see firefighters charging in without hesitation , people of different races helping one another escape to wave of rubble and even the concern of the filmmakers for one another ( they are brothers ) as they can not reach one another in the confusion . There are amazing sights as well as amazing human stories in this film , something Hollywood could never duplicate ( even though it 's trying ) . 9/11 is n't a film about politics . Nor is it a film about religion , nationality or even jihad for that matter . 9/11 is a film about people , and a true indication of the best and worst that we are capable of . 9/11 is quite simply one of the most important films I 've ever seen , and would be the only film to be born from this event if it were up to me . You ca n't duplicate this .
Tiempo de Valientes fits snugly into the buddy action movie genre , but transcends its roots thanks to excellent casting , tremendous rapport between its leads , and outstanding photography . Diego Peretti stars as Dr. Silverstein , a shrink assigned to ride shotgun with detective Diaz ( Luis Luque ) , who 's been assigned to investigate the murder of two minor hoods who seem to have been involved in am arms smuggling conspiracy . Diaz has been suspended from duty , but he 's the best man for the job and must have professional psychiatric help in order to be reinstated . Silverstein and Diaz soon find themselves enmeshed in a conspiracy involving Argentina 's intelligence community and some uranium , and the film separates them at a crucial point that allows Silverstein to develop some impressive sleuthing skills of his own . Peretti and Luque are excellent together and remind me of screen team Terence Hill and Bud Spencer , though Peretti is n't as classically handsome as Hill . Remarkably , even at almost two hours in length Tiempo de Valientes does n't wear out its welcome , and indeed writer-director Damian Szifron sets up a potential sequel in the film 's charming coda . All in all , a wonderful and very entertaining action comedy that neither panders to the lowest common denominator nor insults your intelligence .
this film needs to be seen . the truest picture of what is going on in the world that I 've seen since Darwin 's Nightmare . Go see it ! and If you 're lucky enough to have it open in your city , be sure to see it on the big screen instead of DVD . The writing is sharp and the direction is good enough for the ideas to come through , though hardly perfect . Joan Cusack is amazing , and the rest of the cast is good too . It 's inspiring that John Cusack got this movie made , and , I believe , he had to use some of his own money to do it . It 's a wild , absurd ride , obviously made without the resources it needed , but still succeeds . Jon Stewart , Steven Colbert , SNL , even Bill Maher have n't shown the guts to say what this film says .
This long episode packs amount of astounding of surprises , thriller , mystery and concerns about a battle of wits of Sherlock against Charles Augustus Milverton , a master blackmailer . This is an excellent overlong runtime of Jeremy Brett-Holmes series . In the film appear usual Holmes 's cannon as Inspector Lestrade and Mrs Hudson , though no Moriarty , however is a greatest villain , Charles Augustus . It 's a genuine ripping yarn with intrigue , thrills , and suspense , including an exciting final twist . This is a particular Sherlock movie but we find to Holmes falling in love with a servant , kissing , crying and even robbing . This time along with the episode ¨Scandal in Boheme¨ with Irene Adler , result to be the only one which Holmes is enamored . Top-notch Brett performance , he alongside Peter Cushing are the best Sherlock TV , while in the cinema is forever Basil Rathbone . Brett performs as a resolutive , headstrong , impetuous sleuth . Here Doctor Watson is n't a comic , botcher , and clumsy pal personified by Nigel Bruce , but is an astute and cunning partner well incarnated by Edward Hardwicke , a perfect counterpoint of Brett . Casting is frankly magnificent , special mention to Robert Hardy as astute nasty . Hardy , today famous by role as Cornelius Fudge in Harry Potter , is a veteran actor with forty years of career and with several success such as , The 10th kingdom and Winston Churchill . Furthermore appear secondaries actors with terrific performances , Nickolas Grace , Sophie Gordon , Serena Gordon , among others . The movie gets a colorful atmosphere , the London streets and 221 Baker Street 's house are well designed . The motion picture is well directed by Peter Hammond , director of various episodes . It 's a must see for the Arthur Conan Doyle fans .
On one level , this film can bring out the child in us that just wants to build sandcastles and throw stuff in the air just for the sake of seeing it fall down again . On a deeper level though , it explores a profound desire to reconnect with the land . I thoroughly empathized with the artist when he said , `` when I 'm not out here ( alone ) for any length of time , I feel unrooted . '' I considered Andy Goldsworthy one of the great contemporary artists . I 'm familiar with his works mainly through his coffee-table books and a couple art gallery installations . But to see his work in motion , captured perfectly through Riedelsheimer 's lens , was a revelation . Unfrozen in time , Goldsworthy 's creations come alive , swirling , flying , dissolving , crumbling , crashing . And that 's precisely what he 's all about : Time . The process of creation and destruction . Of emergence and disappearing . Of coming out of the Void and becoming the Universe , and back again . There 's a shamanic quality about him , verging on madness . You get the feeling , watching him at work , that his art is a lifeforce for him , that if he did n't do it , he would whither and perish . Luckily for us , Goldsworthy is able to share his vision through the communication medium of photography . Otherwise , with the exception of a few cairns and walls , they would only exist for one person .
Absolutely enjoyable singing and dancing movie starring Frank Sinatra and gen Kelly , as well as Kathryn Grayson . The film won and Oscar for George E. Stoll 's score , and it garnered nominations for Best Picture , Best Actor for Kelly , and Best Cinematography , as well as a Best Son nomination for `` I Fall in Love Too Easily '' sung by Sinatra . It was a cute story about Kelly helping his pal Sinatra get a girl and falling in love with her himself . The lovely Grayson ( The Toast of New Orleans ) dazzled us with her singing , and we had a lot of great songs and dance routines by Kelly and Sinatra , as well as the artistry of pianist-conductor José Iturbi . A classic Hollywood music from an era gone by .
Deeply emotional . It ca n't leave you neutral . Yes it 's a love story between 2 18 years old boys . But it 's only the body of this movie . And it 's been removed . You only feel what happened with these boys . You feel the soul of the movie . With of course some action , some sex , but this is no pornography , too many feelings . It was only a summer `` story '' , and it became , from love to hate , almost to death , the most important time of their lives . I loved it , you will too , whatever your feelings are .
This is one horror movie based TV show that gets it right . Friday the 13th the series had no connection to the movies . Poltergeist the legacy : I 'm not so sure . It may have been loosely connected to the movies . It feels like they just throw a famous title on a show so fans will watch it . It shows Freddy being burned by the Elm street parents ( in the 1st episode I believe ) and the amount of parents were disappointing . With all the kids he targeted in the 1st 3 movies , you 'd expect there to be more parents . But oh well . Freddy is basically the narrator for the show . He watches the actions of people in the real world sometimes getting involved somehow . Just like other anthology shows like Tales from the crypt , there 's a supernatural or surprise ending twist involved . The acting lacks but believe it or not : the violence sometimes surpasses that of the movie . This show lasted a couple of seasons and was made around the time of the 4th movie . i heard it was canceled due to protesting parents . I watched a lot of R rated stuff as a kid , so its a shame parents had to ruin it for everyone . 4 more movies came after the series , so it was n't a total loss .
I just do n't understand why this movie is getting beat-up in here . Jeez . It is mindless , it is n't polished and it is ( as I am reading ) wasted on some . The cast of this movie plays their characters to the 'T ' ( If you watched Permanent Midnight and became a Ben Stiller fan then yes you will be disappointed ) . These are misunderstood , well-intentioned misfits trying to save the city/world with nothing but grit and determination . The problem is they do n't realize their limits until the big showdown and that 's the point ! This is 3 times the movie that The Spy Who Shagged Me was yet gets panned by the same demographic group , likely the same people who feel the first AP movie pales in comparison to the sequel . I just do n't get it . The jokes work on more then one level ; if you did n't get it I know what level you 're at .
A young man named Court is loved by everyone . His painful bloody death brings everyone closer . You can find other symbols and allusions throughout the movie . Whether predictable or not , and irrespective of ecclesiastical beliefs , this is a moving story , full of milieu and sensuality . One other thing , someone mentioned that his fate was so quick that it did n't seem plausible . But the elements for this are set up subtly . Note what his mom says about bringing his lunch out to the field . Note how he is holding the steering wheel and his gloves . He is sweaty and operating dangerous equipment . To this day , tractors are pretty dangerous .
I have very fond memories of this film , as I saw it with my two younger sisters when it first shown theatrically in 1977 and I was eight years old . Apparently it was deemed a failure - and is now practically forgotten ( the pan-and scan videocassette - which never did justice to the picture or it 's ambitious Panavision compositions is now out-of -print . ) The film is very stylized ( shades of YELLOW SUBMARINE ) and admittedly uneven . Some of the characters and sequences are exquisite while others are somewhat juvenile and undistinguished . The sad discarded blue camel ( shades of Eeyore ) and his blue song are truly heartwarming . Joe Raposo 's songs are for the most part simply beautiful . Definitely a worthwhile curiousity that will probably ( sadly ) fall into total obscurity .
The bittersweet twist to this movie contains a wonderful element of romanticism that evokes an impetuous passion ! These characteristics of idealistic imagery which `` Moonstruck '' possesses , spur on an end result of a resounding thumbs up verdict by virtually every prominent critic in Hollywood . Let me describe the circumstances to this film , simply put , they are `` yesteryear '' . `` Moonstruck '' is a cohesive film which sparks the naivety of an old Italian neighborhood in New York City . New York City has always been one big melting pot that is galvanized by many bicker-some mannerisms which are indicative of typical New Yorkers , this includes a lot of Italian Americans living in New York as well ! The mid and late eighties brought on an abrupt conclusion to many strong associations with various cultural stereotypes . Ethnicity polarization was a firmly embedded scourge in American history that was far more prevalent several generations before this movie was made . These generalizing proclivities still exist today , however , they are more mollified and less identifiable ! For this Italian family of a bygone era , confusion , indecisiveness , agitation , and yes , of course , love , all have the comical camaraderie of an utterly human understanding to them ! The kindred spirits with everyone in `` Moonstruck '' seems to be that of comprehending individual frailties . One might wonder about Cher playing the lead role , as she is more known as an entertainer than a big box office first billing star in a movie . In `` Moonstruck '' , however , I think she was incredibly well suited to her role , and came off as thoroughly believable in a relatively unbelievable situation . All of the characters in `` Moonstruck '' are very rough around the edges , really tough , and not afraid to have a formidable duel with adversity . The most hilarious aspect to their lives is imperfection , and they are thoroughly aware of the fact that weathering the storm definitely serves a constructive purpose ! I thought the acting in this movie was sensational . All relationships in this movie garner an auspicious potential to vividly illuminate because everybody knows how everybody else 's basic nature is really like ! ! For this family , nothing is glamorous , nothing is pretentiously romantic , and nothing is overly emotional ( just moderately so ) . The fact is , this entire family is plainly and perpetually afflicted and overcome by an extremely zealous and candid cupid in all of their lives . Taking moon beams literally can indeed have a pleasantly enervating impact on one 's resolve , masqueraded mystique , and resistance to the proverbial am ore ' . Thus signifying everything ! ! The homey and mercurial tenet in this film is basically one of ; Be honest , get angry ; Be honest , get confrontational ; Be honest , get distorted and emphatic ; Most importantly ; Be honest , and fall in love ! ! This is Cher 's best performance ever as an actress ! ! Nicholas Cage , Danny Aiello , and Olympia Dukakis , were wonderfully flawed in `` Moonstruck '' Such performances by these three were perfectly appropriate for the kinetic energy of the characters in this movie ! Director , Norman Jewison ( Famous for `` Cincinnati Kid '' , `` Thomas Crowne Affair '' , and most famous for `` In The Heat Of The Night '' which won the academy award for best picture in 1967 ) depicts many keen and humanistic instincts in the process of purveying the deliberate incongruity to this film ! I am Italian American in descent , ( Partially anyways ) Cher is not Italian , and , for that matter , neither is the writer nor the director ! I guess since non-Italians like eating our food , they may as well use our culture to make a fabulous film too ! It is refreshing to know that a film can be marvelous and have an incredibly happy ending ! ! For those of you who did n't like this movie , I just have one thing to say `` Snap Out Of It ! ! '' This movie `` Moonstruck '' is totally happy go lucky ! ! Totally eighties ! ! and Totally five stars ! ! See it ! !
Fantastic documentary of 1924 . This early 20th century geography of today 's Iraq was powerful . Watch this and tell me if Cecil B. DeMille did n't take notes before making his The Ten Commandments . Merian C. Cooper , the photographer , later created Cinerama , an idea that probably hatched while filming the remarkable landscapes in this film . Fans of Werner Herzog will find this film to be a treasure , with heartbreaking tales of struggle , complimented by the land around them , never has the human capacity to endure been so evident . The fact that this was made when it was shows not only the will of the subjects , but of the filmmakers themselves .
I 've seen the original English version on video . Disney 's choice of voice actors looks very promising . I ca n't believe I 'm saying that . The story is about a young boy who meets a girl with a history that is intertwined with his own . The two are thrown into one of the most fun and intriguing storylines in any animated film . The animation quality is excellent ! If you 've seen Disney 's job of Kiki 's delivery service you can see the quality in their production . It almost redeems them for stealing the story of Kimba the white lion . ( but not quite ! ) Finally Miyazaki 's films are being released properly ! I ca n't wait to see an uncut English version of Nausicaa !
`` Zabriskie Point '' ( 1970 ) : This was especially interesting to me on a personal level , since it takes place under identical circumstances , with identical peers , in my own life  the Counter Culture movement of the late 60's/early 70 's , on and off campus . We follow two unrelated young people in separate stories , who are slowly woven together . One is a young man in Los Angeles , tired of all the endless , pseudo-revolutionary jabber in the classrooms and lunchrooms of his campus , and , the other , a young woman driving to Phoenix to see her father & employer , and take on an `` establishment '' job . The film is FULL of our Italian director 's ( Michelangelo Antonioni ) visual notations of America , and , the confused , psychedelicrazies of that era 's self-righteous , `` we know it all , we 'll change everything for the better '' youth . Just who IS the `` revolutionary '' ? What does that REALLY mean ? Do you dress like one and march around chanting ? Do you `` fly in under the radar '' but give advance notice of your arrival ? Do you keep your plans to yourself , and go about the business of change , with no need for group approval ? `` Zabriskie Point '' is definitely a `` period piece '' - full of slang , uniforms , somewhat surreal film moments ( after all , this is a film by the man who gave us the amazing `` Blow Up '' of 1966 ) , and the era 's artifacts , but it is more . It presents options for cultural revolution , and going by Antonioni ( who DOES seem to be supportive of it ) , the youth are too self-involved to see what is needed for radical success . Because of this , it becomes a powerful , frightening film that applies to anyone , any time , any place .
She 's not Michael Jordan Think of all the marvelous NBA players whose career light has been dimmed for no other good reason than the timing of their birth . Their names might trip as easily off the public 's lips as Russell , Cousy , Byrd , Magic , McHale , Oscar , Wilt , the list goes on ; but the volume gets turned down a little , for Stockton and Malone , Charles , Patrick and all the other great players who always lost the headlines to Michael . I 've seen it written that Gretchen Mol 's career flamed out in the wake of the cover article in the 1998 Vanity Fair issue which predicted inevitable superstardom for Ms. Mol . It was later said that she had been over hyped . I disagree . I still remember that for some time after I saw `` The Devil 's Advocate '' in '97 or '98 , I would get confused as to which actress played Mary Ann Lomax . Was it Mol or Theron ? Oh yeah ! Charlize Theron was the one in `` 2 Days in the Valley '' and `` Mighty Joe Young '' and Gretchen Mol was in `` Donnie Brasco '' , `` Celebrity '' , and `` Rounders '' . By the time I had seen `` The Thirteenth Floor '' ( Mol ) and `` Sweet November '' ( Theron ) , I pretty much had them straightened out but I still put them in the same mental file drawer . Both were highly talented , had sweet faces , similar body types , short blonde hair and so on . Theron , though , was offered more work . I loved her as Sara Deever and as Adele Invergordon her beauty was downright intimidating . In 2003 `` Monster '' was released and from that point until the handing of the Oscar itself , all of filmdom knew who the `` Best Actress '' award was going to . And deservedly so ! Theron was Aileen Wuornos . The only way to get a more accurate understanding of what made the real Aileen Wuornos tick would be to somehow replay the digital video trapped in Selby 's head . And for a major talent to make herself that physically unattractive ! Unheard of ! Then in 2005 `` The Notorious Bettie Page '' was released . Mol 's performance was extraordinary . Maybe she was standing in the shadow of Ms. Theron . It was like the ballroom for the victory celebration for the losing Presidential candidate , nobody came and nobody cared . It was viewed as a continuation of an old tale , once promising actress with a declining career does a nudie part in a `` B '' movie . Ho hum ! No , no , no ! Wrong ! No matter what you may think of the film ( and I enjoy films about the fifties ) if you pass on this one you 'll be missing one of the better performances of that year . Ms. Moll was every bit as much Bettie as Ms. Theron was Aileen . Unfortunately Aileen , to the film-going public , is the more sympathetic character . For whatever reason , an amoral , sociopathic killer is less embarrassing to us than a naïve , unsophisticated , uninhibited , religious girl whose most capital crime was to live her life totally trusting and completely exposed . Bettie Page was one of the icons of the fifties . Her photos and films never sexual , never pornographic , but she presented as a near caricature of all things kinky . There was no sense of realism , only parody . Ms. Moll captured the very essence of the character . She gained 20 pounds to add some zaftig to her normally slim figure and when she posed for various photographers in the film , her body was Bettie 's . Her full frontal lack of any inhibitions accurately fits everything which has been published about Bettie . Cinematic nudity normally depicts eroticism or sexuality . In this film it 's all about innocence . Seeing Gretchen/Bettie nude did n't make me want to jump her but instilled a desire to protect her from all the horrors that people can inflict on each other . If you pass on this film you 'll be missing out on one of the best performances of recent years . By the way , shame on the MPAA for giving this an R rating .
Sure this movie is not historically accurate but it is great entertainment . Most DeMille pictures especially the later epics are slow and plodding but the action here moves at a clip . The story is basically a series of peaks with very little quiet moments . The action takes us from an Indian raid on a cabin ; one of the best parts of the movie with Jean Arthur excellent while attempting to appease the war-painted natives . This is followed by her and Cooper being taken to the war camp and being tortured . Later comes a protracted battle with the Cheyenne . The whole thing is ridiculous but great fun and entertaining from start to finish . Jean Arthur is one of the best actresses of this era and she shines here .
I commend pictures that try something different . Many films just seem like re-treads of old ideas , so that is the big reason I so strongly recommend Passport to Pimlico . The movie is set just after WW2 and the post-war shortages and rationing seem to be driving Londoners `` barmy '' . The film centers on a tiny neighborhood in London called Pimlico . They , too , are sick of not being able to buy what they want but can see no way out of it . That is until they accidentally stumble upon a hidden treasure and a charter which officially named this neighborhood as a sovereign nation many hundreds of years ago ! With this document , they reason , they can bypass all the rationing and coupons and live life just as they want , since it turns out they really ARE N'T British subjects ! Where the movie goes from there and how the crisis is ultimately resolved is something you 'll need to see for yourselves . Leave it up the brilliant minds of Ealing Studios to come up with this gem !
The first hour or so of the movie was mostly boring to say the least . However it improved afterwards as the Valentine Party commenced . Apart from the twist as to the identity of the killer in the very end , the hot bath murder scene was one of the few relatively memorable aspects of this movie . The scene at the garden with Kate was well shot and so was the very last scene ( the 'twist ' ) . In those scenes , there was some genuine suspense and thrills and the hot bath murder scene had a nasty ( the way slashers should be ) edge to it . The earlier murders are frustratingly devoid of gore .
The story is quite original , but the movie is kinda slow building up to the point where they steal the cars . Its kinda nice though to watch them prepare the stealing too , but the actual stealing should 've been more in picture ... However the stunt work on this movie was excellent and it is definetly a movie you HAVE to see ( 7/10 )
Jane Austen would definitely approve of this one ! Gwyneth Paltrow does an awesome job capturing the attitude of Emma . She is funny without being excessively silly , yet elegant . She puts on a very convincing British accent ( not being British myself , maybe I 'm not the best judge , but she fooled me ... she was also excellent in `` Sliding Doors '' ... I sometimes forget she 's American ~ ! ) . Also brilliant are Jeremy Northam and Sophie Thompson and Phyllida Law ( Emma Thompson 's sister and mother ) as the Bates women . They nearly steal the show ... and Ms. Law does n't even have any lines ! Highly recommended .
`` Protocol '' is a hit-and-miss picture starring Goldie Hawn as a bubbly cocktail waitress who one night saves the life of a visiting Arab from an assassination attempt . The woman immediately becomes a celebrity , and gets a new job working for the U.S. Government . Will the corridors of power in our nation 's capital ever be the same ? Hawn is excellent as usual even though `` Protocol '' is n't as funny as her best film `` Private Benjamin '' . But it 's still a good movie , and I did laugh alot . *** ( out of four )
What happens when the average joe finds out he has supernatural powers ? The premise may sound familiar . The Watchmen ? Unbreakable ? However , the Russian sci-fi action flick , The Sword Bearer , is far from the standard stock . The story revolves around a man named Sasha who as a boy was shunned from society , his peers and family due to a supernatural power that he possess . When he wishes or his anger allows , a sword extends from his arm piercing his own skin . Very wolverinish ? Maybe ... but that 's not the interesting part of this film . Shunned all his life and driven by anger ( and a temper he does have ) our `` hero '' returns to his home town to turn his life around or find a reason to . The only thing he encounters here is trouble when an encounter with an old flame 's new boyfriend leaves him bloodied on the ground . This is where the vengeance and anger comes into play . This is a man you do not want to cross and from this point the mafia and the police are on his tail . He meets a girl and falls in love instantly as does she and this is really what the movie is about . The film is highly impressionistic with bold colors and noir overtones spliced with short yet extreme action sequences . This is art house at it 's core , beautifully filmed with such attention to details in every scene over gruesome sci-fi action . It 's this odd mash that interests me so much in this film . The directors approach for this genre is refreshing focusing on the emotional journey of Sasha and not a straight action film . Do n't worry though , the action is there and plenty of it . However , much of these sequences show only implied violence with pictures of the horrific aftermath . This is not to say that action is not shown . These scenes are here and are fantastic ( especially the ending where we see Sasha 's full powers unleashed in desperation ) . The director chooses to imply the violence of many scenes to keep the focus on the character 's emotional struggle at hand . This is a tragic love story and a refreshing entry into the genre .
With all the `` Adult '' innuendos in todays family movies its nice to see one where you do n't have to worry about that and can just sit back and enjoy a family with your kids . Yes , this movie might have a few swear-words ( there 's that time where Knox swears , but they do n't let you hear the full words ) , but for the most part this movie is truly as clean as they come ( and that 's including movies from back in the day ) . Not only that , its very enjoyable , one of my favorites , and just a great clean and fun movie to watch with the family . The only thing I have against this movie is that it is too short and I wish there could be more of some of the memorable parts that are in it , I 'm not going to mention them because I do n't want any spoilers here . All in all nicely done and a great movie to watch ; so go out and get the kids , make some cookies , and watch this movie !
One of the last classics of the French New Wave . For direction , cineaste Jean Eustache drew from the simplicity of early-century cinema ; for story , Eustache drew on the torments of his own complicated love life . So many things can be said of this film - observationally brilliant ; self indulgently overlong ; occasionally hilarious ; emotionally draining ... etc . etc . In my mind , whatever complaints that can be leveled against this film are easily overshadowed by its numerous strengths . Every film student , writer , or simply anyone willing to handle a 3 hour film with no abrupt cuts , no music video overstyling , no soap opera-like plot twists , and no banal dialogue should make it a point to see this movie . Everything is to be admired : the writing ( concise , clever , surprisingly funny ) , acting ( everyone , quite simply , is perfect in their respective roles ) , and , simple direction ( the viewer feels like a casual observer within the film ) make this film unforgettable . This is undoubtedly a film that stays with you .
My mother took me to see this film as a child and I long to see it every year as I do all of my other Christmas favorites . What I remember most was the silly Devil and Santa looking through his telescope . I waited and looked through the T.V . Guide each year after that to see when it would be shown . I would usually find it playing on a Saturday afternoon . I only found the movie in English which took something special away from the film and have longed to find a copy of it in Spanish . I hold this film dear to my heart and have never suffered from nightmares as others might suggest . Yes , it is a different film about Santa Claus and that is what makes it special and unique . I ca n't wait to get a copy of this film and watch it with my children as I explain to them my favorite parts and memories ! !
I came to Nancy Drew expecting the worst ... because of everyone else 's bad reviews . I thought : Even though I do n't read the books , that does n't look anything like the Nancy Drew I 've heard of . But I was wrong . Sure , it was n't a carbon copy of the books , but when you make a movie out of something , you have to modify it to become big-screen entertainment . The plot was enjoyable and thrilling with a lot of actual scares and I thought that Emma Roberts was really believable in her own way of portraying this classic character . There were several funny moments and on the contrary of many statements , at no point in this film does Nancy come off as a ditz . She was intelligent , conservative , polite and genuine . One thing this movie also did well was balance the whole thing out with a mix of comedy , romance , suspense and heartfelt moments . I loved this movie . What a flick , what a flick ! And if you are wise and decide to trust me and go see this , be prepared for some SCARY as heck moments because I was , like , freaking out ! Go see it or be a bum-bum and just let other people decide what you think of this movie for you ... a mistake I almost made . I love it , I wan na own this movie ! I love Emma Roberts now , too . She 's like a mini-Bree Van De Kamp from DH . Love it , love it .
The cinematic interests in the British monarchy continues with The Young Victoria ( 1837 to 1901 ) , after having seen in recent years , the efforts with Keira Knightley 's The Duchess , Cate Blanchett 's Elizabeth films , and Scarlett Johansson and Natalie Portman 's take on the Boleyn sisters with The Other Boleyn Girl . More contemporary stories would include Helen Mirren 's award winning portrayal of The Queen on the current reign of Queen Elizabeth II at the turn of Princess Diana 's death . Each of the films mentioned featured stunning actresses with acting gravitas ( ok , so some may dispute Johansson ) or were the flavour of their moment , and each film had a definitive moment in their historical character 's legacy that it becomes a no brainer to have those events featured , and in fact Elizabeth had enough to span two films . However , The Young Victoria , as the title already suggests , is a lite-version of the young queen 's life , and if you 're looking for that definitive event , or the staple political intrigue that plague all royal households and their dealings with shady , self-serving politicians , unfortunately there 's nothing of depth here . That 's not to say The Young Victoria is without . Directed by Canadian Jean-Marc Vallee ( best known for CRAZY ) and written by Julian Fellowes , this film chronicles in very plain terms , , the life and times of Victoria ( Emily Blunt , soon becoming the new It girl ) when she was a child , the troubles she faced before Coronation such as the eagerness of her mom The Duchess of Kent ( Miranda Richardson ) and her adviser Sir John Conroy ( Mark Strong ) to appoint themselves as joint-Regent to her throne , as already planned for by reigning King William ( Jim Broadbent ) . As if that was n't enough , the political power play enters the picture with Lord Melbourne ( Paul Bettany ) being a Prime Minister-in-waiting trying to gain the trust of the new Queen , and subtly plants his own trusted allies into positions within the palace . On one hand you 'd understand the need for a young , and new Queen to have trusted people in key positions , but on the other , are they really acting in her interests , or in the interests of others ? Even this angle of intrigue creeps into her romantic story with Prince Albert ( Rupert Friend ) , where their relationship forms the bulk of the second half of the film , and pretty much everything already included in the trailers . For both , they 've been brought up under the influence of others , and told each step of the way exactly what to do . Even their union may seem like a firm registration of an alliance , if not for both lovers recognizing their common need to establish their own grounding , and to do so with the help of each other . Instead of being pawns , there 's this constant search and probing of opportunities to break out of stifling , and at times absurd , rules and regulations . Trust also becomes a much valued commodity , and loyalty too can be traded for wanting to set the slate clean . However , all these themes become but a breeze through the narrative , from childhood to romance , marriage and children . In fact , there 's so much fast-forwarding here , especially the last few minutes filled with inter-titles , that it actually leaves the audience wanting for more , and room of course for another movie , which I suspect would probably not see the light of day , but perhaps a television series might pick up on the film 's response , and come out with a mini-series or such . It 's a pity that all the effort here in ensuring the gorgeous costumes , sets and art direction would be confined to a film that 's quite lightweight in theme and brief mention of issues , that they do n't really challenge the protagonists in order to allow for some overcoming of character-defining adversary . With its star-studded cast , one would expect more , but one would be left wanting more instead . Recommended for those who are ever curious about Kings and Queens in the British Monarchy , only as a complement to other more engaging stories available in the other films already mentioned .
This movie captures the essence of growing up in smalltown America for a young girl on her own . The realism and subtle nuances , offered to Ashley Judd 's character , Ruby , by the storyline , capture what can only be described as a true to life setting in the panhandle of Florida . From the slam of a screen door , to the lack of work , the echoes of what life is really like on the `` red-neck riviera '' provide rough choices for the young girl . Paradise did not come easy . But she slowly overcomes obstacles and deceit , and learns to be her own woman , with a strength that flows from within . Ashley Judd 's winning smile , and infectious gait exude warmth and command respect and admiration . The careful pace of the character development resembles that of `` Ulee 's Gold '' in 1997 , starring Peter Fonda , and also directed by Victor Nunez .
As one other IMDB reviewer has remarked , this movie starts a bit slow , but gets considerably better as it goes along . Yes , it is released by Roger Corman , and yes , it goes over some of the same thematic ground as much higher budget predecessors such as FATAL ATTRACTION and POISON IVY . However , the juxtapositioning of the wife 's career as a rising blues singer against the husband 's gathering loneliness and his almost Freudian need for filling the emotional and physical `` void '' or `` hole '' while she 's away along with the clever use of minimal effects and settings is nicely done . Utilizing a very small number of locations and characters , and also using water in almost every scene both as a cleansing and drowning metaphorical symbol throughout , this movie , though clearly suffering from a minuscule budget , reminds me in many ways of the more fully realized and more recent scenario , namely the French film `` SWIMMING POOL '' which it seems to me at least may have borrowed liberally some useful ideas from `` UP AGAINST AMANDA . '' With a smaller tool set , UP AGAINST AMANDA maintains its suspense with a rudimentary , fatalistic view of surrendering to ones occasional lustful temptations , but accomplishes this as well or better as other films in this genre . The twist of the stepfather abuse of Amanda in the past ( again , very Freudian ) is also very unique in this genre and interesting . I agree with other viewers about the unexpected and sympathetic reaction for Amanda 's plight this aspect of the story elicits . The cast is excellent I think .
What a night . Perry Mason then Have Gun , Will Travel followed by Gunsmoke ( when it was a half hour ) and finally at 10:30PM came 'Sea Hunt ' with its wonderful opening theme music and Mike 's boat sailing off to a new adventure . Terrific.. Regardless of the story it was the lead character ( played by Lloyd Bridges ) , strong , honest , sincere . A Man 's Man and a Boy 's Man . This brought on an interest in boats that lasted for years . Why they do n't show on cable or make it available on video , no idea.. Too bad .
No other movie has made me feel like this before ... and I do n't feel bad . Like , I do n't want my money back or the time that I waited to watch this movie ( 9 months ) nor do I feel bad about using two hours of a sunny summer day in order to view this ______ . The reason I say `` _____ '' is because no matter how hard I wrack my brain I just ca n't seem to come up with a word in ANY of the seven languages that movie was in to sum it up . I have no idea what was going on the entire time and half way through the movie I needed a breather . No movie has ever done this to me before . Never in my life have I wanted cauliflower , milk , and baguettes this much . Thank you . - Ed Uh . *clears throat* No words . No thoughts . I do n't know . I truly do n't know . - Cait
Like Tarzan the Ape Man ( 1932 ) , only more so . There 's more of everything , more animals , more varied African tribes , and scenes in which the thought must be , if this was good with three or four lions , forty would be better . Tarzan wrestles with crocodilesthe the crocodile machine spins in the water like a rolling pin , around and around , jaws flapping . Tarzan can kill it with his ubiquitous knife if the blasted saurian would hold still . Tarzan kills lions and rhinos and a steadily increasing number of animals . His friends are real chimps , people wearing larger ape costumes , and elephants . In fact , they use Indian elephantsfar more friendly and trainable than African oneswith costume ears attached to their heads . The human story : another white man , worse than the rest , shows up to join with Holt to go after the ivory from the elephant graveyard . Tarzan wo n't show them the way , so the bad guy shoots an elephant so they can follow it to its deathbed . Tarzan intercedes , and the bad guy shoots himbut , of course , he survives and returns to save Jane . Everybody else dies , Holt and the bad guy and every single one of their `` boys . '' People are expendable , especially Africans , and there does n't seem to be much distinction between the black fellows who die because they work for the white men travelling through taboo country and those black fellows who kill them . This must be the last Tarzan movie before the Hays Code made Jane wear more clothes . There are a number of underwater scenes in which Jane swims nude , and though the light is flickering the movement and the glimpses are very appealing . Apparently one of Weismuller 's friends from the Olympic swim team did the nude scenes , and not Maureen O'Sullivan . She , however , moves through the movie wearing the same sort of loincloth Weismuller wears ( plus a bikini top ) , showing a splendid glimpse of thigh and hip . They still do n't need to talk a lot . They sleep together and hang out with cool animals and stay away from cities . No wonder they 're happy .
When it comes to Paul Verhoeven and erotic thrillers , most people think of `` Basic Instinct '' and some maybe of `` Showgirls '' . But Verhoeven has made his best erotic thriller years before these two movies : `` De Vierde Man '' . This film is mesmerizing and mindblowing - and above all the story is absolutely plausible , which makes the whole experience even more intense . The performances by Jeroen Krabbe , Renee Soutendijk and Thom Hoffman are exceptional , and Verhoeven 's direction does the rest . `` De Vierde Man '' makes even `` Basic Instinct '' look quite tame ... It ca n't get much better than this , a true classic of erotic nightmare cinema . 10 out of 10 , at least ...
The 63 year reign of Queen Victoria is perhaps one of the most documented and popularly known historical reigns in British history . On the one hand , her story lacks the theatrics of earlier royals thanks to a change in social climate and attitudes , and on the other her story is one that perpetuates because it is notably human . Taking on the earlier years of her life where the budding romance between herself and the German Prince Albert was taking forefront , director Jean-Marc Vallée who has only until recently remained in the unbeknownst shadows of the industry here takes Victoria 's story and captures that human element so vital to her legacy . It 's a story that feels extremely humble considering its exuberant background , and yet that 's partly what gives it a distinct edge here that separates it from the usual fare . Taking a very direct and focused approach that centres in on a brief five or so year period between her ascension and marriage to Albert , The Young Victoria does what so little period pieces of this nature offer . Instead of attempting a sprawling encapsulation of such a figure 's entire life , Vallée instead opts to show one of the lesser known intricacies of Victoria 's early years which are easily overlooked in favour of the more publicly known accolades . The result is a feature that may disgruntle historians thanks to its relatively flippant regards to facts and the like , yet never to let document get in the way of extracting a compelling story , writer Julian Fellowes sticks to his guns and delivers a slightly romanticised yet convincing portrayal . Vallée takes this and runs , making sure to fully capitalise on those elements with enough restraint to maintain integrity in regards to both the history involved and the viewer watching . A major part in the joy of watching The Young Victoria play out however simply lies in the production values granted here that bring early 1800 's Regal Britain to life with a vigorous realism so rarely achieved quite so strikingly by genre films . Everything from the costume designs , sets , hair styles , lighting and photography accentuates the grandiose background inherent to Victoria 's story without ever over-encumbering it . Indeed , while watching Vallée 's interpretation come to life here it is very hard not to be sucked in solely through the aesthetics that permeates the visual element ; and then there 's the film 's score also which works tremendously to further the very elegant yet personal tones that dominate Fellowes ' script . Entwining the works of Schubert and Strauss into Victoria and Albert 's story not only works as a point of reference for the characters to play with , but also melds to the work with an elegance and refrain that echoes composer Ilan Eshkeri 's original work just as well . Yet for all the poignant compositions , lush backdrops and immaculate costumes that punctuate every scene , the single most important factor hereand indeed to most period dramasare the performances of the cast and how they help bring the world they exist in to life . Thankfully The Young Victoria is blessed with an equally immaculate ensemble of thespians both young and old that do a fantastic job of doing just that . Between the sweet , budding romance of Victoria ( Emily Blunt ) and Albert ( Rupert Friend ) and the somewhat antagonistic struggles of her advisors and the like ( spearheaded by a terrific Mark Strong and Paul Bettany ) , the conflicts and warmth so prevalent to Fellowe 's screenplay are conveyed perfectly here by all involved which helps keep the movie from being a plastic `` nice to look at but dim underneath '' affair so common with these outings . In the end , it 's hard to fault a work such as The Young Victoria . It 's got a perfectly touching and human sense of affection within its perfectly paced romance , plus some historical significance that plays as an intriguing source of interest for those in the audience keen on such details . Of course , it may not take the cinematic world by storm and there lacks a certain significance to its overall presence that stops it from ever becoming more than just a poignantly restrained romantic period drama ; yet in a sense this is what makes it enjoyable . Vallée never seems to be striving for grandeur , nor does he seem content at making a run-of-the-mill escapist piece for aficionados . Somewhere within this gray middle-ground lies The Young Victoria , sure to cater to genre fans and those a little more disillusioned by the usual productions ; beautiful , memorable but most of all , human . - A review by Jamie Robert Ward ( http : //www.invocus.net )
after seeing this film for the 3rd time now i think it is almost Adam 's worst film PUNCH DRUNK LOVE IS POOR in comparison to this i must say at the end when Dickie gets thrown of the boat it is so funny ( the hair is different to his and i like it when he flips everyone off . This film should only be brought if your a true Adam Sandler fan . the characters are poor in comparison to his funny films like the Waterboy , which has the same people in it ( Peter Dante ) who is one of the assassins trying to kill the Australian bird . this film lack depth and a decent story line and deserves to be in the bottom 100
A meteorite falls in the country of a small town , bringing a jelly creature . An old farmer is attacked by the alien in his hand , and the youths Steve Andrews ( Steve McQueen ) and his girlfriend Jane Martin ( Aneta Corsaut ) take him to Dr. T. Hallen ( Steven Chase ) . The local doctor treats carefully the blister , and asks Steve to investigate the location where they found the old man . When Steve returns , he sees the blob killing the doctor . Steve and Jane try to warn the police and the dwellers , but nobody believe on them , while the blob engulfs many people , getting bigger and bigger . `` The Blob '' is a cult and classic sci-fi . It is a low budget movie , with many ham actors and actresses ( with the exception of Steve McQueen ) , awful effects , but also delightful and very , but very funny . This is the first time that I see this classic ( I had seen the 1988 remake with Kevin Dillon ) , and I really recommend it to fans of Steve McQueen and sci-fi B-movies from the 50s . The film subject of my review number 1,400 could not be better . My vote is seven . Title ( Brazil ) : `` A Bolha '' ( `` The Blob '' )
I 'm stunt , I must admit I never saw a movie with such good story and none stop high special effect martial art fighting scene . If you like the fantastic genre , like me , you will certainly be more than satisfied ! All character have very cool power and the special effect are near perfection , in one word , flawless ! I will listen to this movie a lot in the next years .
It has been about 50 years since a movie has been made about romance and mysticism . The only two movies I can think of is `` Enchanted April '' ( 1992 ) and `` The Enchanted Cottage '' ( 1945 ) . Both movies used wonderful actors not stars . In both movies , all the actors gave their best romantic performances . `` Enchanted April '' is about four English women after WWI who are unhappy with their lives and find happiness in Italy while on vacation . It is amazing `` Enchanted April '' was made in 1992 . It stands out as an enjoyable classic .
Ever wanted to know just how much Hollywood could get away with before the Hayes Code was officially put into effect ? Well , unfortunately `` Convention City '' is lost , so well just have to watch `` Tarzan and His Mate '' to find out . For 1934 , there is a remarkable amount of sexual innuendo and even exposed flesh . Just look at Jane 's nude swim . While Tarzan is often thought of as b-adventure films made for young boys and no one else , this picture proves that the series was originally very adult . Over seventy years later , it is still as sexy as it was when it came out . In addition to the envelope pushing taboo nature , it is a superb and exciting adventure story . I 've always enjoyed the jungle films that Hollywood churned out in the 30s and the 40s , but there are few from the genre I 'd call great films . `` Tarzan and His Mate '' is by far the best film from this long gone subgenre . The sequences of the attacks on the safari by either apes or natives still manage to create tension today . Also , the animals are all too cool ( espescially the apes throwing boulders ) . The acting wo n't win any major awards soon , but is certainly more than adequate for this type of picture . The film is once again stolen by Cheetah , the smartest monkey in the jungle . One of the most entertaining examples of pre-code Hollywood out there .
No hidden agenda . Pure scifi . All fun . I saw the original on TV and was scared pretty bad . I was a kid : ) The original one can be appreciated more when compared to the new one which I saw and have forgotten . The original one , starring the great movie star Steve McQueen ( BULLET ) , is by far the better and only version anyone should see . The movie production is dated , but the fx used to make the Blob stands up the test of time . I was convinced that that thing was moving on its own accord . 10/10 -Zafoid
2003 was seen as the year of the Matrix , with the release of two sequels and a computer game that actually linked to the plot of the film . Also released was a DVD of 9 short animated films , most written and made in Japan and made as Anime . Japan makes some of the best animation in the world . Sadly most of these shorts are disappointing . The best of them is the first part of a prequel to the first Matrix film . The Second Renaissance is made as a historical file . It tells how humans made machines in their own likeness . Humans live the high life whilst machines are the grunts , the workers of society , second class citizens . In the year 2090 , a machine , BI-66ER was put of trial for murder , after killing his owners who wanted to deactivate him . The machine does not have a fair trial and riots start around the world . The governments of the world order to dismantle machines . Many machines leave human society and form their own country in the Middle East , O1 . 01 has a productive economy and easily undercut the human nations , forcing them into economic crisis . The human blockade 01 and reject the machines requests for peace , thereby it was the humans who were responsible for the war that enslaves them . The Second Renaissance is a interesting watch , with excellent , traditional animation style and sets a compelling world . It shows how the machines were mistreated and that humanity sowed the seeds of their own destruction . There is a political and social world and the short tells a lot in it short running time . The short shares themes and a style to the classic silent film Metropolis , partly the beginning with the underworld . They are the themes of slavery , the mistreatment of the working class and racism . The short also has some religious themes and religious iconography . Mainly that men saw themselves as God and created the machines in their own likeness . Seeing themselves as the rightful masters of the machines . The machines too use religious iconography , mainly forming their nation in 'cradle of human civilisation ' and the machines coming to the United Nations dressed as Adam and Eve , offering an apple . The animation style is beautiful , done in the traditional anime style ( like Akira ) . The set designs are great , combine futuristic with historic cities , e.g . Washington D.C.. There is well down future scene , and surprising violence , which is key to the film . The director , Mahiro Maeda , also directed the anime sequence in Kill Bill Vol . 1 , so has good credentials to Hollywood . He is willing to use violence and know how to keep a story going . The only real complain is a continuity error to the first Matrix film because Morpheus mentions that the humans have no historical records or know who started the war . But its a good watch .
DER TODESKING is not one of my favorite Jorg Buttgereit film - but still is an interesting film dealing with suicide and it 's reasons and ramifications . Those looking for a gore-fest , or exploitation in the style of the NEKROMANTIK films or SCHRAMM will probably be disappointed . DER TODESKING is definitely an `` art-house '' style film , so those that need linear , explainable narratives need not apply ... The basic concept of DER TODESKING is that there is an `` episode '' for each day of the week that revolves around a strange chain letter that apparently causes people to commit suicide , interspersed with scenes of a slowly decomposing corpse ... There are some very well done and thought provoking scenes , including the man talking about the `` problems '' with his wife , and the concert massacre ( which unfortunately lost some of it 's `` power '' on me , because I was too busy laughing at the SCORPIONS look-alike band on stage ... ) . But seriously - this is a sometimes beautiful ( the scene that shows different angles of that huge bridge is particularly effective - especially if you understand the significance of the scene , and that the names shown are of people that actually committed suicide from jumping from the bridge ... ) , sometimes confusing , sometimes silly ( the SHE WOLF OF THE SS rip-off is pretty amusing ) , sometimes harrowing ( I found the scene of the guy talking to the girl in the park about his wife particularly effective ) film that is more of an `` experience '' then just entertainment , as many of these `` art '' films are meant to be . Still , I did n't find DER TODESKING to be as strong as NEKROMANTIK or SCHRAMM , and would probably put it on relatively even footing with NEKROMANTIK 2 in terms of my personally `` enjoyment level '' . Definitely worth a look to any Buttgereit or `` art '' film fan . If you dig this type of film - check out SUBCONSCIOUS CRUELTY - in my opinion the BEST art-house/horror film that I 've seen . 7/10 for DER TODESKING
I ca n't understand why many IMDb users do n't like this movie . Why they think it 's sooooo bad etc . It 's not worse than anything else out there . Personally I think `` Soldier '' is a great movie , far better than most other films in the same genre . Reasons why I liked `` Soldier '' : Kurt Russel , Connie Nielsen , Jason Scott Lee , the script ( David Webb Peoples ) , great visual effects , and the directing ( Paul Anderson ) . I even think that this is the best work I 've seen from director Paul Anderson , who has previously directed the entertaining `` Mortal Kombat '' and the not so entertaining `` Event Horizon '' .
I LOVE Jack 's jokes like 'The cliché is ... ' or `` Over the top cliché guy , black , oily skin , kinda spooky ... '' . He is just hilarious ! Daniel 's starting to catch up on him to ! Good thing Jack 's not on the team anymore ( in a way ) or else it would have been sarcasm mania ! ! ! ! I just love all the plots ( season 8 , a little less , I have to admit ) , the characters are great , the actors are great , I 'm starting to pick up facial expressions ( and more ) from Jack , Daniel and Teal'c ... It just all theoretically possible and exciting ... oops ! Their I go again ! ! ! Sorry , I 'm also starting to pick up traits from Carter , and all of this is driving my parents NUTZ ! ! ! ! ! ! ! Well , to conclude , I think it 's good for another three seasons or so , especially if they keep on packing the episodes with all this humor , drama , action and so forth ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! !
The second official episode of the `` Columbo '' series ( `` Murder by the Book , '' filmed later , hit the airwaves first ) . Robert Culp , who would match wits with Peter Falk 's detective in several future installments , is terrific as the short-tempered head of a sophisticated private detective agency who murders a client 's wife when she refuses to cave-in to his blackmail schemes . The two stars are well-matched in this clever cat and mouse exercise that is one of the best in the series .
First off , I did n't know what to expect when I started the video . Anytime someone brings back a cult type movie genre and adapts it into the present , something gets inexplicably lost in the translation . That 's not the case here . This movie just starts off on the right track . It 's part familiar territory but manages to take it over the top as well . Crockzilla scene anyone ? That has to be seen , and just try and keep a straight face . This movie takes some of the old fun cult movie classics and manages to blend it seamlessly into a modern production . It 's good to see someone is filling the need in this market . Very well done .
I saw this movie on Comedy Central a few times . This movie was pretty good . It 's an interesting adventure with the life of Sunny Davis , who is arranged to marry the king of Ohtar , so that the U.S. can get an army base there to balance power in the Middle East . Some good jokes , including `` Sunnygate . '' I also just loved the ending theme . It gave me great political spirit . Ten out of ten was my rating for this movie .
The `` gangster '' genre is now a worn subject one that is too often subjected to parody . In retrospect the series is a culmination of previous clichés that have been utilized in it 's genre , thankfully the writers have advanced upon this flaw by creating a realism which has been applied to it . The Sopranos is an epic crime saga that illustrates it 's content with psychological depth that is characterized with subtle nuance , humor and unvarnished violence . The key protagonist Tony Soprano is perceived as a perilous general bereft of fear and moral values by his crew , however , Tony is of two persona 's one which is bestial while the other is conflicted with guilt and resent . With out any inhibitions or contradictions I still adamantly believe that The Sopranos has the finest ensemble cast of recent memory . All things considered I could make an elaborate statement on the series , but I wo n't . If ever there is a visual dictionary in global consumerism search for these definitions vital , ambiguous , unrelenting , epic , uncompromising and the sopranos shattered visage will be smiling right back at you .
Passing stones definitely one of the best comedy independent films ever . You must have a sense of humor to fully enjoy this one . This film for some reason has n't received its credit due . First , lets start with the story line everyone loves a good treasure hunt . When a dead father leaves letters behind advising of a hidden treasure it not only brings two families together but starts a whirlwind adventure . Mix in a polish translator , a comatose mother , a crack-head with turrets syndrome , a twisted homosexual hypnotist , and one drag queen , money not only makes the world go round but can turn family into enemies . My favorite character in this film would have to be the sister/crack addict with turret 's syndrome , her sudden out burst will have you crying and mimicking for weeks .
Mr Michael Jackson is an artistic phenomenon . His short movies , i.e . music videos , are simply the best . I do not care if I get a sane sci-fi feature from this man , but I do care to get a medley of his crazy dancing , shriek yells , cool crowd choreography , and some bits of CGI and animation . There also should be a few uninterrupted videos . Everything I 've mentioned is here . Stupid plot and over-the-top `` vanity fair '' are not a problem when I witness Mr Michael Jackson in action . To me he will always be the ultimate king of music videos ( not `` king of pop '' which sounds moronic , especially for us , Russians , because `` pop '' sounds like the Russian word for `` arses '' and MJ is definitely not `` king of arses '' ) . I can re-watch his best music videos ( which are artistically beautiful ) and I never get tired of them . My first impression of this film was `` What is this ... ? '' ( bits of different videos , some drawn images , unsettling jumps from one theme to another , absence of any cohesive plot line , some kids fooling around , etc . ) but as I watched it till the end , I could tell that it was great and really nothing like anything else shown on TV nowadays . What I like here too is that it never shows any shameful material and can be watched by kids easily . Without Mr Michael Jackson the universe of music videos would be rather poor . Even the best classic videos of other artists can not come very close to the energetic hyperbole of MJ musical insanity and artistic quality . He knew how to get the audience of different ages and he knew how to remain a man with moral principles . When I see a proper DVD release with Mr Michael Jackson videos I know that it deserves to be purchased even if some clips have already appeared in some other previous release . `` HIStory I '' , `` HIStory II '' , and `` Moonwalker '' are all great , though only `` Moonwalker '' is more like one movie ( with a solid `` Smooth Criminal '' theme , `` paparazzi '' topic , and a few weird spoofs and twists ) . Being no fan of MJ I can still give this `` film ... like no other '' a solid 9 out of 10 ( I 've been hit by `` Smooth Criminal '' for sure and my major complains are the following : initial segments of the movie could have been dropped while the main `` MJ anti-drug campaign '' should have been given more `` sky-rocketing insanity and stress '' and there should have been more `` moonwalking '' itself of course ) . Thanks for attention .
This was basically an attempt to do the same thing with `` Batman '' that was done with `` Gilligan 's Island '' in `` Surviving Gilligan 's Island . '' For those of you who missed it ( and shame ! ) `` Surviving Gilligan 's Island '' ( full title : `` Surviving Gilligan 's Island : The Incredibly True Story of the Longest Three Hour Tour in History '' ) was a special from a few years back , where Bob Denver ( `` Gilligan '' ) , Dawn Wells ( `` Mary Ann '' ) and Russell Johnson ( `` The Professor '' ) related the story of the show 's creation , cancellation , rediscovery & rebirth . Along the way , stories were dramatized with actors portraying the original cast and crew . It was very well done . It was funny , well cast and came across as a genuine document of the show . `` Return to the Batcave : The Misadventures of Adam and Burt '' is in a similar style . The re-telling of the history of the show , the re-enactments , the general feel are all the same . What 's missing is the straightforward approach that `` Surviving '' took . In `` Return '' , Adam West and Burt Ward both receive invitations to a car show to which they were not meant to be invited . After being allowed to stay , Adam and Burt witness the theft of the centerpiece of the show : the legendary Batmobile ! Adam and Burt decide to chase after it themselves , leading them through clues that cause them to think about the history of the show . This eventually leads to the revelation of who stole the Batmobile and why . Choosing to use this conceit ( actually having a plot ) is the biggest letdown of this show . Unlike `` Surviving '' , `` Return '' forces the viewer to follow a less interesting storyline ( the theft of the Batmobile ) instead of focusing all its attention on what the audience would most be interested in ( the history of the show . ) It is the historical sections that work the best . The casting ( as in `` Surviving '' ) is excellent . Jack Brewer ( `` Adam West '' ) and Jason Marsden ( `` Burt Ward '' ) capture the feel of the actors without looking *too* much like them . Brett Rickaby ( `` Frank Gorshin '' ) bears a stronger resemblance to his subject , but captures none of the late Gorshin 's charm , only his characterizations . Other actors ' portrayals are short and functional , with none standing out as especially good or bad . Many of the stories have been told before , but they mostly play out amusingly , with only the occasional clunky presentation . Another wonderful bit from the historical sections was the use of audition footage of Lyle Waggoner 's tryout for the part of Batman . The only place where the flashbacks fail is when they insert obviously made up plot points to advance the main story . This downgrades the accuracy of the flashbacks needlessly . The `` main plot '' ( if that is what we must call it ) is , of course , ludicrous . This is not really a fault in and of itself , but it 's just not carried off well enough to cover up the shortfall . Strong performances and good writing can make up for a silly plot ( especially in these kinds of things ) but we really get neither , here . The performances by West and Ward seem somewhat flat ( even for them ) ; the dialog too carefully written for it to feel natural . Again , I think the comparison to `` Surviving Gilligan 's Island '' can be seen in that the dialog is mostly just there to set up a flashback . In `` Surviving '' , that 's all it intends to be . In `` Return '' it tries to do double duty and , unfortunately , often fails . Gorshin and Newmar do well ( although I agree with others that Gorshin had not aged well and that Newmar had - and what 's Waggoner taking to look that good ? ) but are n't given enough to do . Again , I think they all would have been better served by a more straightforward presentation than the one chosen here . Another odd point about `` Return '' . This special is about the `` Batman '' TV series and its history , yet all the clips shown are from the theatrical movie . Even the Waggoner footage is technically movie footage . If you know you 're `` Bat-history '' , then you know that the movie was originally planned to be made first , only to be delayed in favor of the TV show when CBS needed to fill time fast . So when Waggoner and West were testing for the role , it was for the movie , not the TV show . Why `` Return '' only uses movie footage is unclear . It most probably has to do with rights issues , but it is a distinct distraction to those in the know : seeing Julie Newmar in the present , but only footage of Lee Meriwether as Catwoman in the past . Overall , I liked the show , mainly for the flashbacks . I would have preferred the style used in `` Surviving Gilligan 's Island '' , but I can understand why they 'd want a more story-oriented piece given the subject matter . Besides , I like these people . It 's nice to see them out and about , still having fun with one of the great pieces of entertainment history . I just wish they had done it a little better and when more of the original cast was still alive to be there .
Many people know how it feels when a loved one is lost . The feelings of pain , grief and sorrow can be unbearable . However , sometimes it is the memories they leave behind that trigger the saddest emotions . This theme is superbly portrayed in the short film 'Tulip ' , directed by the award winning Australian actress , Rachel Griffths . Described as a movie 'as much about memories as it is about love ' , a string of sensitivity and sentimentality is expertly threaded into this triumphant 15 minute film . 'Tulip ' is a beautifully wrought , touching and heart-warming story of a man 's journey in coming to terms with the loss of his wife through the relationship he shares with a very special animal , 'Tulip ' . The film opens with a rising dawn , the chirping of birds and a vast landscape , introducing the sense of rustic harmony present throughout the film . A soft music plays , marking the entrance of Ruth ( Jean Bain ) . She wears a flowered dress and apron with a sun hat on her head . She gently pets Tulip , caressing her ears and patting her back . The furnishing of the house is impressive and the attention to detail is creditable ( a vase of tulips can be seen on the bench ) , reflecting the peaceful rural community . Will ( Charles 'Bud ' Tingwell ) greets Ruth as she is spooning the milk from the bucket . They pour the milk and coffee together , a sign of companionship and teamwork . Not a word is said but it is obvious that their relationship is close and affectionate ; they paint a perfect picture of happiness . Sadly , happiness does n't last forever . The tragic passing of Ruth affects Will deeply . An effective scene of fading cars highlights Will 's isolation and vulnerability at the end of the day of the funeral . Soon he sinks into depression and becomes oblivious to his surroundings when everything seems hopeless and lost . At Will 's moment of despair , Tulip becomes the symbol of Ruth , the genuine connection Will has with his late wife . It was through Tulip that Will learns to cope with the absence of Ruth and overcome the heartrending feelings of loneliness . Each of the characters is realistically and solidly portrayed , especially the part of Will . Charles 'Bud ' Tingwell brings the character to life through personal investment . The recent loss of his own wife ( Audrey Tingwell ) is effectively reflected in his acting . Every sag of his shoulder and every frown on his brow make the viewer empathize strongly with the character . The character of Ruth is wonderfully carried out by Jean Bain . Although Ruth does not say a single word throughout the movie , her sweet personality and loving relationship with Will are obvious . Lois Ramsey and Kati Edwards give delightful performances in supporting roles as the friendly Margaret and Mary . They also add a subtle humor to the bittersweet story . An anecdote from Griffths ' childhood , the story of loss and discovery is remarkably captured in 'Tulip ' . Beautifully shot and superbly acted , this film will surely make you misty eyed , triumphant or feel like drinking a cup of milk .
This is truly one from the `` Golden Age '' of Hollywood , the kind they do not make anymore . It is an unique , fun movie that keeps you guessing what is going to happen next . All the actors are perfectly cast and they are all great supporting actors . This is the first movie I saw with Ronald Colman in it and I have been a fan of his ever since . Reginald Gardiner has always been a favorite supporting actor of mine and adds a certain quality to every movie he is in . While he played a different kind of character here , he still added something to the movie that another actor cast in this character would not have added .
The movie was gripping from start to finish and its b/w photography of the American heartland is stunning . We feel we are right there with them as they cross the big sky country and then into Mexico and back to America again . Near the end of the movie , the reflection of the rain on Robert Blake looks like small rivers of sweat and tears rolling down his face . In the end , we follow them up the stairway to their final moment . The two criminals , performed by Robert Blake and Scott Wilson , as Perry Smith and Dick Hickock could be seen on any street in any town . Hickock is a smiling boy next door and Smith , the guy with stars in his eyes from the wrong side of town . This point is made in the movie and it always surprises us that criminals are no different in appearance than anyone else . Evil , even the most vile , is part of the human condition . These two delusional men kill an entire family , looking for a safe that is n't there . Once on the run , they start writing bad cheques , carving out a trail for the authorities . There are many fine supporting actors . I like John Forsyth as the detective on the case , Alvin Dewey . Also , Will Geer shines in a brief but excellent scene as the prosecuting attorney . I have often wanted to see this movie all the way through , having only caught it in short snatches ; I did finally get to it after buying the DVD . The result is the finest classic crime movie I have ever seen . Do n't miss this brilliant movie . To me , this is what great film-making is all about .
The 1930s . Classy , elegant Adele ( marvelously played with dignified resolve by Debbie Reynolds ) and batty , frumpy Helen ( the magnificent Shelley Winters going full-tilt wacko with her customary histrionic panache ) are the mothers of two killers . They leave their seamy pasts in the Midwest behind and move to Hollywood to start their own dance school for aspiring kid starlets . Adele begins dating dashing millionaire Lincoln Palmer ( the always fine Dennis Weaver ) . On the other hand , religious fanatic Helen soon sinks into despair and madness . Director Curtis ( `` Night Tide , '' `` Ruby '' ) Harrington , working from a crafty script by Henry Farrell ( who wrote the book `` Whatever Happened to Baby Jane ? '' was based on and co-wrote the screenplay for `` Hush ... Hush , Sweet Charlotte '' ) , adeptly concocts a complex and compelling psychological horror thriller about guilt , fear , repression and religious fervor running dangerously amok . The super cast have a ball with their colorful roles : Michael MacLiammoir as a pompous elocution teacher , Agnes Moorehead as a stern fire-and-brimstone radio evangelist , Yvette Vickers as a snippy , overbearing mother of a bratty wannabe child star , Logan Ramsey as a snoopy detective , and Timothy Carey as a creepy bum . An elaborate talent recital set piece with Pamelyn Ferdin ( the voice of Lucy in the `` Peanuts '' TV cartoon specials ) serving as emcee and original `` Friday the 13th '' victim Robbi Morgan doing a wickedly bawdy dead-on Mae West impression qualifies as a definite highlight . David Raskin 's spooky score , a fantastic scene with Reynolds performing an incredible tango at a posh restaurant , the flavorsome Depression-era period atmosphere , Lucien Ballard 's handsome cinematography , and especially the startling macabre ending are all likewise on the money excellent and effective . MGM presents this terrific gem on a nifty DVD doublebill with `` Whoever Slew Auntie Roo ? ; '' both pictures are presented in crisp widescreen transfers along with their theatrical trailers .
I was worried that my daughter might get the wrong idea . I think the `` Dark-Heart '' character is a little on the rough side and I do n't like the way he shape-shifts into a `` mean '' frog , fox , boy I was wrong , This movie was made for my kid , not for me . She `` gets it '' when it went over ( under ? ) my head . Of course I do n't `` get it '' . This is n't one of the NEW kids movies that adults will ALSO enjoy . This is straight for the young ones , and the crew knew what they were doing . There is n't any political junk ether . There 's no magic key that will save the world from ourselves , nobody has the right to access excess , and everyone is n't happy all the time . And as a side benefit , nobody DIES ! russwill .
They had me from the first show . Welcome to Trinity County . A sleepy little Mayberry-like place with one slight difference . The sheriff is really Satan . There 's the spoiler . Not like you would n't figure it out in 10 minutes anyway . Oh , but that 's not all . It turns out that Satan has a son named Caleb . Some people are trying to keep him good , but it 's an uphill battle . Sheriff Buck ( Satan ) knows who Caleb is and likes to spend time with him teaching him the ways of darkness . Subtle . Sneaky . He does n't always come off as evil . Most of the time he 's a hero . Everyone owes him a big favor , because he often sets up a calamity and saves them from it . So every time you think someone will finally take him down , one of his friends comes out of nowhere to sabotage it . In one of my favorite episodes , Lucas and Caleb were out in the woods in a cabin and some guys with guns decided to rob them . Lucas used it as an excuse to teach Caleb a lesson about evil . The robber ( Ted ) was hesitant to shoot them . Lucas told Caleb that Ted had half a conscience . If he had no conscience , he would have shot them by now . If he had a real conscience , he never would have become a criminal . So he started calling him Half-Ted . It was pretty funny . He was taunting the criminals . And of course he stayed 10 steps ahead of Half-Ted at all times . And of course he was in complete control at all times . They actually had you favoring Satan . Very very excellent show . it was one of my favorite horror shows of all time . Twilight Zone Night Stalker Circle of Fear American Gothic Supernatural That 's good company .
Being the first feature film with Robert De Niro ( although not released for years later ) , this is worth the watch . De Niro 's role is n't huge , yet amusing as one of two friends who first try to prevent another friends marriage only to later chase him down to force him into it . Any die hard De Niro fan will get a kick out of an early performance by arguably the best actor today .
Yes it was a little low budget , but this movie shows love ! The only bad things about it was that you can tell the budget on this film would not compare to `` Waterworld '' and though the plot was good , the film never really tapped into it 's full potential ! Strong performances from everyone and the suspense makes it worthwhile to watch on a rainy night .
This film does not fail to engage and move , even in 2008 to an audience only familiar with modern over-produced sound and computer enhanced techniques . The experience of the movie goer in 1922 who could only see this in a cinema with others on their big screen must have been truly profound and a thoroughly satisfying experience . One has to ask could a film maker today make a two hour silent movie and make it interesting and achieve the same structure tempo and balance as this movie has . Silent film making was pure art , it had to hold the attention through its structure , direction and acting - there was no padding out with more words or computer generated distractions . A poorly made or uninteresting silent movie is unwatchable . This film needs to be put into context for those who might be disconcerted with the mention of Christian themes . This is not a 'Christiany ' film , it is not selling anything . These themes along with reference to current moral standards often appear in this era - also church going on Sundays was a national past time , Christianity was a given in most households thus the film is only depicting normal life as it was then . The themes would have rung true and deep at the time . It is most odd given the strong support to good Christian thinking of this particular movie ( and it is not preaching religion to anyone , only highlighting the difference between hypocrites and the honest ) that in 1922 a Pastor in an open debate with a representative from the film industry with a large crowd denounced Pickford as an example of immorality , along with some other individuals he named . NY Times 1922 . Maybe they should have watched this movie that also came out in 1922 and , learned some lessons . The Pastor complained that since the film industry had started church attendance had dropped 500,000 . The film representative in the debate however made the following observations ; that saloon attendance had also dropped , that there were far more pastors in prison than actors ( fact ) and that selecting a few examples from among the many was not representative of the whole . Thus there was an ongoing battle between church and the film industry during the early days of film . This is a wonderful film about being honest and true to family friends and to be willing to make sacrifices . Mary Pickford , naive , honest , feisty , full of happiness and joy , faithful , humorous and silently sacrificing - though poor and uneducated she represented the perfect character . This however is not thrust down our throat but revealed bit by bit through the film . This is reminiscent of some modern Chinese films where characters are slowly , languidly revealed over the course of a film and it is this tempo that creates a stronger connection with the character . It has a smooth even tempo for the first half that builds all the elements for the last section . The last 30 minutes are great film making and it has to be appreciated it was achieved without the benefit of sound , running dialog - it was achieved through deft acting and great directing . It is sometimes surprising to realize that at the end of the film you have n't hear a word spoken , but it feels like you have heard everything . The supporting cast put in great performances especially Gloria Hope , Jean Hersholt and Lloyd Hughes . The final few minutes are typical Pickford understated humor as she goes outside under the pretext of sweeping the snow , a near perfect balance and ending . This is a special type of touching humor that should not be underestimated . Chaplin used this device often and copied some of from Pickford . Another special observation to be made about Silent films and especially Pickford films is that the star often has to hold the camera for much of the movie without the audience becoming jaded or bored , with the actors over-exposure . That Pickford is usually thoroughly the center of attention through most of her movies but the people still could n't get enough of her is a testament to her fine acting ability .
A hot-headed cop accidentally kills a murder suspect and then covers up the crime , but must deal with a guilty conscience while he tries to solve a murder case . Andrews and Tierney are reunited with director Preminger in a film noir that is as effective as `` Laura , '' their earlier collaboration . Andrews is perfectly cast as the earnest cop , a good guy caught up in unfortunate circumstances . The acting is fine all around , including Malden as a tough police captain and Tully as Tierney 's protective father . The screenplay by Hecht , a great and prolific screenwriter , is taut and suspenseful , and Preminger creates a great atmosphere .
Amazing performance from Simon Pegg who just gets better and better with every role . As usual he plays the part of a very cringy character who makes you want to hide behind your cushion in embarrassment for him sometimes , but thats what Pegg is all about . The laughs were regular and eye watering and everyone of them aimed at Penn . The movie was very cleverly put together where every character plays a very sophisticated and serious part with Penn being the only humour involved which is a huge credit to the Director Robert Weide . And I cant let this one go without a quick round of applause to Gilliam Anderson who shone throughout . Highly recommended to all .
I have seen `` Miracles Still Happen '' now at least four times . I never tire of this fantastic movie . From the very beginning , it holds a person 's interest . As the movie progresses and the plane crashes the story becomes very intense as we watch this young girl trying to survive alone and frightened in the Amazon , following a plane crash in which she was the only survivor . Losing her mother in this plane crash as well makes this movie even more dramatic as we see the perils this young girl had to endure during her ten days in the Amazon . To think this really did happen is just unreal and to think that anyone could actualy survive this is unspeakable as we see the wild animals , snakes and other reptiles , the enormous forests and wildlife as well as countless insects . As the movie progresses we see the many dangers this girl has to face as she tries to follow the river in hopes of it leading her to a town . Remembering what her father told her about how a stream will always lead to a river and then into an even larger river and this means it will eventually lead to a community , this young girl keep track of the tiny stream which eventually lead into a huge river all throughout the movie . At times having to swim in dangerous waters , alone , frightened , injured , she always managed to keep going . Towards the end of this movie it was obvious she would not have been able to continue much longer as she had not eaten in ten days and only had water to drink and was very sick and tired from her perils . Eventually as she sees a canoe , she realizes there has to be a village and men find her and they take care of her and then take her to a hospital where her father comes to see her , after fearing she was dead along with the many other passengers . Such a dramatic movie and so heartwarming to see her father 's face when he sees his daughter is actually still alive after all this time in the Amazon ! Movies like this are n't made much those days . I will still see it again and I know I will never tire of it ! To think this girl was the only one single survivor of this airplane is just unspeakable ! Also the fact she only maintained a few very slight injuries was even more remarkable , whereas everyone else on this airplane perished in the horrific crash into the wilds of the Amazon . A brilliant movie , superbly acted out indeed and one I will treasure forever and love to continue watching ! Strongly recommended by me for sure !
An excellent depiction of one of the more unwholesome aspects of that era . I loved the visuals -- very fitting for a story connected to a graphic novel . I thought Tom Hanks was really great in this , he came across very well as someone who has been hardened by his work ( which he did n't fully choose for himself ) but still wants to have a normal life for his family . He does the best he can to see that happen . DO n't want to spoil the plot -- but YOU HAVE TO SEE this movie if you are a person who wants more from a movie than the usual shoot 'em up action/gangster format . ( It is violent though . )
A great film requiring an acquired taste . If you 're into action , wham bam films and hate serious love stories then its not for you . Otherwise , if you like to sit in front of a good intelligent movie now and again I recommend this very highly . Easily the best film produced in Bollywood this century . The only other Indian film I would give 10/10 for is Dil Wale Dulhaniya Le Jayenge . Even then it comes second to this masterpiece .
'Shock Corridor ( 1963 ) ' was my first film from Samuel Fuller , and there I was impressed with the director 's astute blending of B-movie and big-budget aesthetics , even if the story itself was pure schlock . 'Pickup on South Street ( 1953 ) ' was released a decade earlier in Fuller 's career , obviously produced on a larger budget from a big-name studio , Twentieth Century-Fox . Nevertheless , the visuals are still notable in that there 's a somewhat raw , naturalistic element to the photography , not unlike Dassin 's 'The Night and the City ( 1950 ) ' and Kazan 's 'Panic in the Streets ( 1950 ) ' { the latter was also shot by cinematographer Joe McDonald } . In some scenes , Fuller shoves the camera so close to his actors ' faces that they 're out of focus , bluntly registering the intimate thoughts , emotions and brief inflections that are communicated through that most revealing of facial features , the eye . Though ( unexpectedly ) prone to melodrama , and with just a hint of anti-Communist propaganda , 'Pickup on South Street ' is a strong film noir that succeeds most outstandingly in its evocation of setting  the underground of New York City . When just-out-of-prison pickpocket Skip McCoy ( Richard Widmark ) snags the purse of a woman on the subway ( Jean Peters ) , he pockets more than he 'd originally bargained for . The woman , Candy , and her cowardly ex-boyfriend Joey ( Richard Kiley ) had been smuggling top-secret information to the Communists , and McKoy has unexpectedly retrieved an important roll of micro-film . Will he turn in the MacGuffin to the proper authorities , or sell it to the highest bidder ? If 'Pickup on South Street ' has a flaw , it 's that the story seems designed solely to bolster an anti-Communist agenda , reeking of propaganda like nothing since WWII { Dwight Taylor , who supplied the story , also notably wrote 'The Thin Man Goes Home ( 1944 ) , ' the only propagandistic movie of the series } . For no apparent reason , every identifiable character  even the smugly self-serving Skip McCoy  eventually becomes a self-sacrificing patriot , the transformation predictable from the outset . In traditional film noir , the unapologetic criminal always gets his comeuppance , the rational punishment for his sins , but apparently not when they 've served their country ; patriotism wipes the slate clean . Richard Widmark , an actor who I 'm really beginning to like , plays the haughty pickpocket with composure , though always with that hint of ill-ease that suggests he 's biting off more than he can chew . The opening scene on the train is the film 's finest , as McCoy breathlessly and silently fishes around in his victim 's hand bag , recalling Bresson 's 'Pickpocket ( 1959 ) . ' Thelma Ritter is terrific as a tired street-woman who 'll peddle information to anybody willing to pay for it ( though , of course , she draws the line at Commies ) . Jean Peters is well-cast as the trashy dame passing information to the other side , playing the role almost completely devoid of glamour ; Fuller reportedly cast the actress on the observation that she had the slightly bow-legged strut of a prostitute . Nevertheless , Peters must suffer a contrived love affair with Widmark that really brings down the film 's attempts at realism . Fascinatingly , upon its release , 'Pickup on South Street ' was promptly condemned as Communist propaganda by the FBI , and the Communist Party condemned it for being the exact opposite . Go figure .
This is what the musical genre was made of . Humor , talent , romance , and action all rolled into one . Frank Sinatra was wonderful . Nothing else needs to be said . Marlon Brando , although not a singer , did a great job winning the hearts of many with his portrayal of Sky Masterson . The fact that he could n't sing added to his character . The ladies in the film were alright , but the men in the movie definitely stole the show . It is a true classic that can be appreciated at any age . It connects with all audiences and makes you smile and laugh . Definitely a movie to be watched and enjoyed !
Indian cinema typifies cops of two broad categories : they are either the honest type or the bad guys . The honest guys always shout at the top of their voice and fight the system while the bad cops enjoy for most part but suffer at the end . This movie at least breaks this usual formula and gives a refreshing view of cops and their lives . The direction takes an inside look at the life of a young ambitious cop who . The music is interesting and the editing is a trend setter as far as Indian cinema goes . The movie is slow at times and the dilemma which Anbu faces when it comes to Maya is overplayed at times . But I would still give this one 9/10 simply because it has many firsts to its credit .
okay , but just plain dumb . Not bad for a horror/comedy film . I was reading how people switched it with the Michael version and that is a good trick in my opinion because some grown ups hate horrors and when they see this one it will get them interested in horror films like this one or maybe ( never seen it ) the horror ( possibly comedy ) uncle Sam , i 'll have to see about renting or buying that film but the 2nd is way better then this one but i bought this one on VHS of Amazon and got it November 21 , the day before thanksgiving . worth the four bucks , l.o.l . at this film . 9/10
I enjoyed this movie and I had very low expectation due to all the negative reviews I read before going . I went because I was curious as to what all this fuss was about because some of the postings were so angry with this movie and with the Koreans . Oh and it 's from Korea which has put out some of my favorite movies . I liked Host but not my absolute favorite . Some of my favorite sci-fi /fantasy movies so you can have a sense of my taste : Mirrormask , Stardust , Serenity , Gattaca , Willow , Matrix , Resident Evil series , LOTR , Stargate , Dark City . It was n't confusing like everyone said and the monsters looked good and the battles great . There are some holes in the story but did n't really matter . I sort of tune out stuff like that and stopped asking why long time ago when I see summer blockbusters . The Korean legend was interesting , the reincarnation stuff was different , and I thought the main characters suspiciously dressed like Korean actors in other shows . Ethan 's ( Behr ) hair looked so Asian . Yes , it could be better and I hope in the future that Korea , with its unusual quirky sense of life , intense emotions , and unexpected humor , can bring some diversity to the blockbuster genre . Maybe a combination of Host and Dragon Wars in the future ?
For Anthony Mann the Western was 'legend'- and 'legend ' makes the very best cinema ! Mann 's work was full of intensities and passions , visually dramatic , and the action always excitingly photographed ... Stewart , a docile actor with the ability of displaying anger , neurosis and cruelty , made with Anthony Mann , five remarkable Westerns : `` Winchester '73 ; '' `` Bend of the River ; '' `` The Naked Spur ; '' `` The Far Country ; '' and `` The Man from Laramie . '' In `` Winchester '73 , '' Stewart reveals his darker side ... He offers all the reserves of anger , inner ambivalence , and emotional complexity in his nature that his audiences had , up till this time , failed to catch ... A carefully chosen cast increases the proceedings in fine style : Shelley Winters is at her saucy best ; Dan Duryea perfect as the vicious , sneering psychopathic villain ; John McIntire great as the unscrupulous character ; Charles Drake so good as the man who attempts to face his tormentor ; and a very young Rock Hudson , attempts the role of an Indian Chief ... `` Winchester '73 '' is the story of a perfectly crafted and highly prized , rifle in the Dodge City Kansas of 1876 ... Stewart and his estranged brother , who bears another name ( Stephen McNally ) , compete fiercely for possession of it , and though Stewart wins , McNally steals it and sets off cross-country with Stewart in pursuit ... What gives the pursuit an element of the demonic , is Stewart 's determination to revenge his father 's death at the hands of that same renegade brothera revenge fed by long-standing fratricidal hatred ... Photographed in gorgeous Black & White , the film comes on as powerful and arresting , acted with deep feeling and intense concentration , not only by Stewart but by all the supporting characters ... Look fast for a promising newcomer , Tony Curtis , the soldier who finds the rifle after the Indian attack ...
I read that this did not well , that the story is not solid , that Volckman feels he has failed in some way . I disagree . First , it is well executed . Volckman is doing well to not only to try a new technique , but to have a focus that is worth thinking about : would immortality reduce the value of life ? Big question ... I can see he trying hard to build a feeling , and he is not compromising . This is to be applauded . I am sure it was an interesting exercise to build characters in such a form . I have seen artists reduce a form to bare minimum to build the intensity of a moment . I identify this film with this . Further , it is much more interesting than Richard Linklater 's roto-scoping , and Volckman 's story has more meaning than Linklater 's later stories of a wasted life on drugs . Old news . Everyone knows it , but no one does anything about it . Renaissance has more to offer , something new to think about . And there are many more stories out there with loads of holes in them that do far better . Well done , Volckman . Really nice work .
In the year 1985 ( my birth year ) Steven Spielberg directed an emotionally strong and unforgettable story of a young African-American girl Celie ( Debut role for Whoopi Goldberg ) whose life is followed through rough times . The story begins from the year 1909 when Celie is only 14 years old . She has given birth two children for her father . Celie has a younger sister Nettie with whom she is inseparable . A widower lays his eyes on Nettie but their father gives Celie to him . It is the beginning of an era of horrible abuse and constant controlling . Women are inferior of men and especially being an African-American woman their rights are less than a zero . Celie 's story is a true survival story . `` The Color Purple '' is a master-piece and underestimated film of Spielberg . He should make more drama which `` The Color Purple '' and `` Schindler 's List '' are good notion . The cast is amazing . Whoopi Goldberg is known better as a ravingly funny comedienne but the introducing role as Celie is a remarkable word that she really can pull of heavy drama . Danny Glover was surprisingly nasty `` Mister '' . I have never seen him in a such an evil role . The talk-show icon Oprah Winfrey is brilliant as a strong-willed Sofia . Warning ! Prepare to have a number of tissues with you when watching this film . You can really connect to the story of the strong sisterhood . Especially if you have as close relationship with your siblings like I have with my sister . Big applauds to Mr. Spielberg !
Rachel Griffiths writes and directs this award winning short film . A heartwarming story about coping with grief and cherishing the memory of those we 've loved and lost . Although , only 15 minutes long , Griffiths manages to capture so much emotion and truth onto film in the short space of time . Bud Tingwell gives a touching performance as Will , a widower struggling to cope with his wife 's death . Will is confronted by the harsh reality of loneliness and helplessness as he proceeds to take care of Ruth 's pet cow , Tulip . The film displays the grief and responsibility one feels for those they have loved and lost . Good cinematography , great direction , and superbly acted . It will bring tears to all those who have lost a loved one , and survived .
Jeanette MacDonald and Nelson Eddy star in this `` modern '' musical that showcases MacDonald 's comic abilities . Surreal 40s musical seem to be making fun of 40s fashions even as they were in current vogue . Eye-popping costumes and sets ( yes B & W ) add to the surreal , dreamlike quality of the entire film . Several good songs enliven the film , with the `` Twinkle in Your Eye '' number a total highlight , including a fun jitterbug number between MacDonald and Binnie Barnes . Also in the HUGE cast are Edward Everett Horton , Reginal Owen , Mona Maris , Douglas Dumbrille and Anne Jeffreys . Also to been seen in extended bit parts are Esther Dale , Almira Sessions , Grace Hayle , Gertrude Hoffman , Rafaela Ottiano , Odette Myrtile , Cecil Cunningham and many others . Great fun and nice to see the wonderful MacDonald in her jitterbug/vamp routines . She could do it all .
The delivery of some very humorous rude lines by Pierce Brosnan is alone worth the price of admission . He plays a kind of `` James Bond 's psycho twin brother '' , separated at birth , no doubt . As an intense hit-man , his character is very sexual but even better , very funny . Add the kind-hearted , uber-likable American `` guy next door ' , Greg Kinnear , to set up contrast . The myriad locations , vivid colors , and quick-witted humor provide great entertainment . Hope Davis is well cast as the `` gem of a wife '' . But the focus of the film is on the two fellows , a new `` Odd Couple '' , and that 's the part that works very well . Have a great ( probably R-rated ) laugh , and look for the places where the story goes a little deeper .
Even though there are no new episodes , and it is rarely showed . I used to love the magic of Sabrina and the teenage witch . I never got to see the last episodes , but I do want to know what happened to Miles , or Josh ? And why did the aunts have to disappear out of the show for good ? I 'm sure the ending went to be perfect . But there are a lot of questions unanswered . And I want to see the last episode of S.T.T.W ! Because I heard she decides between Erin and Harvey on her wedding day ! I really hope that she picks Harvey ! And may I say Nate Richart is HOTT ! ! Too bad hes too old for me though . Melissa Joan Hart has her own sense of cuteness that she adds to the show , but there are many little `` stupid '' things for the show such as how famous bands come out of nowhere and play songs and all the cast is listening , its kind of stupid . Plus the cat starts to really get lame , as the show continued , the jokes began just to get stupid , and the things that the audio controlled `` audience '' would laugh at , I would think it was so lame . Do n't get me wrong , at some parts it was funny , but I think the show just kind of lost its `` magic '' so to speak as the show went on . I give kudos to all the cast though for trying , although that Soleil Moon Frye girl had no taste , and she was a horrid actress . I wonder what Melissa or any of the cast is doing now for that matter , now that the show has ended .
`` Atlantis '' is a new and right step for a Disney feature . It 's a good choice to make a film by such a mysterious legend like `` Atlantis '' . I did n't have any expectations for this film , but after watching it , I do n't quite understand why this film got so bad reviews . Even in my country the reviewers were n't positive . `` Atlantis '' is not a perfect movie , but still one of Disney 's greatest , even I doubt that this film ever will get `` Disney classic '' reputation . Well , that 's another case . It 's funny to think that this sci-fi movie was directed by the same directors as `` Beauty and the Beast '' and `` Hunchback '' ( so Kirk Wise and Gary Trousdale are trying to get away from their monster movies reputation , he he , I 'm just kidding ) . Well , enough nonsense . `` Atlantis '' is a watchable , exiting and very enjoyable film . Even this film it 's a PG-rated action-feature , it 's also suitable for kids , in my opinion ( parents who mean the opposite , do n't kill me for writing this , he he ) . The story is a little predictable , but it does n't ruin the movie . The comic book-inspired animation it 's suitable for the film and set 's a departure from the usual Disney-style . It 's colorful , dark and detailed . The Deep Canvas sequences are pretty impressive . The film is also funny sometimes , even I more giggled than laugh through the movie . ( SPOILERS ) The characters of this film are also very likable , but unfortunately there is n't enough screen time to get to know everybody , so some characters are left behind ( SPOILERS ) . The score of James Newton Howard is absolutely great . It 's daring and exotic . ( SPOILER ) The most impressive about this film is how they 're making the Atlantean language sound very natural , ethnic and authentic . It 's really awesome ( SPOILERS OVER ) The script is tight and well-written , but still the there are some questions left unanswered in the story . But luckily there are not so much of them . So do you 're self a favor , do n't listen to the reviewers and watch `` Atlantis '' , cause it 's waiting for you ...
Before all , I 'd like to point out that I have not read the book , so there was no chance I 'd be disappointed in that aspect . The major flaw I spotted was historical detail , with several cars , trains , clothes , etc . I think don´t belong at that time . ***Possible spoiler***** The technical aspect of the film is ok , nothing to brag about . But the acting , I think , was terrific . I do n't have no experience in acting , still I ca n't believe how people can consider this terrible ! Maybe they 've only seen two movies ( ever ) , and the other one must have been very good indeed ! I specially liked Jeremy Irons , and really understood his character , someone who crawled up the social ladder with very hard work , then fights against those who would take his life 's work from him , only he gets so involved in this fight , he does n't realize reason is no longer at his side , and he ends up a beaten , disappointed man . Irons made this so believable , I sympathized with the character despite his brutality . After Jeremy Irons , Winona Ryder is also wonderful as a romantic young women , who is drawn into the revolutionary ideals by her boyfriend ( Banderas , he had an under-developed part , I think ) , and Glenn Close was also very good . Meryl Streep had an average performance , it was not bad , just not up to the standards of the other actors . Watch out for Miguel Guilherme , a fine Portuguese actor , between so many stars . In contrast to today 's movies , here only the interpretations , only people matter , but at the same time , it is not a pretensious film , too worried trying to be intellectual . The best proof I really liked it , I 'm writing a review 7 years later .
The wonderfully urbane Ronald Coleman is show-cased here as in few other of his films . He is literally in every scene and this comical movie remains fresh because of him , not in spite of him . He is handsome , witty and very clever here as he remains a step ahead of his wandering , lovely wife -- played perfectly by Anna Lee . The movie is based on a french play and brings all the best qualities of that farce . Most of the supporting cast is well known , at least by face if not name ... and are absolutely perfect for this very funny film . The fantastic Mr. Coleman is a combination of Sean Connery and Clark Gable as he stays a step ahead of the other characters . His multi-talents can be further appreciated in the classic `` Lost Horizon '' which every film buff must see .
I happen to run into this movie one night so I decided to watch it ! I was very pleased with the movie ... I thought it was a wonderful plot . It 's a great feeling knowing a deceased one has come back and you get that second chance to say what you want to say ! And this wife stayed devoted for 23 years ! ! ! I thought it was a great movie ! !
After `` A Dirty Shame '' , I never thought that I was going to see another John Waters movie . That movie was really so bad , that I was convinced that all his movies would be like that . But when the DVD of this movie was reviewed in a popular magazine and they said that this was an excellent movie , I decided to give it a try anyway . Only a couple of days later it was shown on television . I taped it out of curiosity and now that I 've seen it , I can tell you that this `` Pecker '' sure is a lot better than `` A Dirty Shame '' . In this movie we see how a young 'nobody ' from Baltimore becomes an overnight sensation in the art world of New York . He 's a sandwich shop employee who photographs his weird family or things that he sees on the street as a hobby . When he keeps his very first 'exhibition ' in the shop where he works , his pictures are noticed by a gallery owner who loves the pictures full of misery and weirdness . His photographs are sold for enormous prices , but when he sees how his family , friends and strangers react to his success he decides that he will no longer go to New York , they will have to come to him if they want to see more of him . And they do , but what they get to see there , is a bigger shock than they could ever imagine ... It 's not difficult to see why I loved this movie a lot more than `` A Dirty Shame '' . The first reason is that this movie has an actual story . This movie really has something to say and is n't just intended to shock as many people as possible . The fact that they make fun of the art world who considers everything out of the ordinary as art because they do n't know what the reality is like , is n't just funny , it 's not that far from the truth either . I guess there are many people who feel about modern art that way . Nobody understands why they are making such a fuss about it , but apparently we are all supposed to like it . The second reason why I liked this movie is because this one had much better acting performances to offer . I 'm not saying that everything that you will see is great , but at least the characters have some meaning thanks to the performances of the different actors like Edward Furlong , Christina Ricci , ... Overall this is n't a great movie , but thanks to its criticism and some good jokes - which never really go too far - this is an enjoyable movie . It certainly is n't the best comedy ever , but I liked it a lot more than `` A Dirty Shame '' . I give this movie a 6.5/10 .
First off , I must say that I made the mistake of watching the Election films out of sequence . I say unfortunately , because after seeing Election 2 first , Election seems a bit of a disappointment . Both films are gangster epics that are similar in form . And while Election is an enjoyable piece of cinema ... it 's just not nearly as good as it 's sequel . In the first Election installment , we are shown the two competitors for Chairman ; Big D and Lok . After a few scenes of discussion amongst the `` Uncle 's '' as to who should have the Chairman title , they ( almost unanimously ) decide That Lok ( Simon Yam ) will helm the Triads . Suffice to say this does n't go over very well with competitor Big D ( Tony Leung Ka Fai ) and in a bid to influence the takeover , Big D kidnaps two of the uncles in order to sway the election board to his side . This has disastrous results and heads the triads into an all out war . Lok is determined to become Chairman but wo n't become official until he can recover the `` Dragon Head Baton '' , a material representation of the Chairman 's power . The current Chairman , Whistle ( Chung Wang ) has hidden the baton somewhere in mainland China and the race is on to see who can recover it first . Much of the film is devoted to the recovery of the Baton . As both aspiring leaders search for it they must dodge cops and opposite sides , which leads into one of the stand out scenes in Election , which involves an underling named Jet ( Nick Cheung ) , a machete , and lots of bad guys . Nick Cheung 's presence is attention grabbing to say the least ... I wonder if this influenced director Johhnie To in any way while making the second Election , as he does deliver more of Jet 's character in the sequel . While Nick Cheung gives a scene stealing performance , I must not fail to give due to the rest of the film 's actors . Election has a great ensemble cast with well thought out performances that are both subtle and impacting . Simon Yam is his usually glorious self and the film also benefits from heavyweight HK actors like Louis Koo , Tony Leung Ka Fai , and the under-appreciated Suet Lam . There really are n't any weak links in the acting and one could easily believe that they 're watching real gangsters . Although the performances are great , one of the most impressive things about Election is Johnnie To 's eye for the camera . There are some truly striking shots in the film and it goes without saying that To definitely knows how to frame his shots , as the viewer is treated to a series of innovative and quite brilliant camera placings and angles . All of which makes Election , above all , a great looking film . My issues with the film arises mostly out of the shear amount of characters involved in Election . It gets a bit hard to follow because the film is so full of characters that are n't integral to the plot . While the sequel opts to focus more on the two candidates , the first Election offers the election process as a whole with tons of Uncles , underlings , and police officers crowding the storyline . Maybe the film would have worked better if it would have been a bit longer with more time dedicated to the inner workings of the Triad , or if Director Johnnie To would have funneled down the necessary elements and expounded on them more . Bottom Line- All in all , this is a wonderfully brutal film with a great cast , excellent direction , and leisurely pacing that packs a punch . It 's just a little more complicated than it needed to be .
I have been a Star Trek fan for as long as I can remember . When they announced the planning and premiere of the fifth series I was very excited . The premiere of Enterprise was well worth the wait . It was well done with the perfect setting and a great acting job done by all the characters . The NX-01 , Enterprise is the perfect vessel to show the beginnings of what many people have come to love . Scott Bakula was just superior as Captain Jonathan Archer . Jolene Blalock gave a commanding performance as Subcommander T'Pol . That it just two people of this wonderful new crew that is boldly going to take us into the great history of Starfleet . Enterprise looks like it 's going to be a good series well worth watching , and I recommend that . Watch it .
I just saw this film on Turner Classic Movies last night and was blown away by Victor McLaglen 's performance : In every sense of the word a `` tour de force '' . The atmosphere of 1922 Dublin evoked through the cinematography and production design really foreshadowed techniques used in the best film noirs of the 40 's and early 50's.Very nice attention to detail also ; during Frankie McPhillip 's ( Wallace Ford 's ) wake , the mourners are all praying in Gaelic . Max Steiner 's score is unforgettable . As in later films such as 1939 's GWTW , he appropriated folk ballads to lend local color and a sense of place and time . John Ford : already a film giant in 1935 !
Although the word megalmania is used a lot to describe Gene Kelly , and sometimes his dancing is way too stiff , you have to admit the guy knows how to put on a show . In American In Paris , he choreographs some outstanding numbers , some which stall the plot , but are nonetheless amazing to look at . ( Check out Gene Kelly 's `` Getting Out Of Bed Routine '' for starters ) Gene Kelly stars as a GI who is based out of Paris , he stayed there to paint , soon he is a rich woman 's gigolo , but he really LOVES SOMEONE ELSE ! Hoary story sure , but the musical numbers save the show here ! I really loved Georges Gu¨¦tary 's voice work in this one . His 'Stairway to Paradise ' and his duet with Le Gene on 'S Wonderful ' is 's marvelous ' . Oscar Levant and Leslie Caron I can take or leave . All in all , a pretty good , but not dynamite movie .
I 've watched this movie twice , and I plan to see it again . It is the movie that puts you in the director 's place , regarding his romantic relations and the political situation in Israel . It also makes me cry because of remembering the wonderful time it was , and the horrible murder described there . It is really worth watching .
A slight , charming little movie to be sure , but a superbly-crafted one . Gwyneth Paltrow shines in this early showcase for her British accent , and the cast assembled around her all lap up the dialogue . This came out around the time of Sense and Sensibility , and I 'm sure I do n't know why that one garnered all the Oscar attention . Emma is Jane Austen 's most accessible and least stuffy story , told well .
I went into Deathtrap expecting a well orchestrated and intriguing thriller ; and while that 's something like what this film is ; I also ca n't help but think that it 's just a poor man 's Sleuth . The classic 1972 film is obviously an inspiration for this film ; not particularly in terms of the plot , but certainly it 's the case with the execution . The casting of Michael Caine in the central role just confirms it . The film is based on a play by Ira Levin ( who previously wrote Rosemary 's Baby and The Stepford Wives ) and focuses on Sidney Bruhl ; a playwright whose best days are behind him . After his latest play bombs , Sidney finds himself at a low ; and this is not helped when a play named Deathtrap ; written by an amateur he taught , arrives on his doorstep . Deathtrap is a guaranteed commercial success , and Sidney soon begins hatching a plot of his own ; which involves inviting round the amateur scribe , killing him , and then passing Deathtrap off as his own work . Despite all of its clever twists and turns ; Deathtrap falls down on one primary element , and that 's the characters . The film fails to provide a single likable character , and it 's very hard to care about the story when you 're not rooting for any of the players . This is not helped by the acting . Michael Caine puts in a good and entertaining performance as you would expect , but nobody else does themselves proud . Christopher Reeve is awkward in his role , while Dyan Cannon somehow manages to make the only possibly likable character detestable with a frankly irritating performance . It 's lucky then that the story is good ; and it is just about good enough to save the film . The plot features plenty of twists and turns ; some work better than others , but there 's always enough going on to ensure that the film stays interesting . Director Sidney Lumet deserves some credit too as the style of the film is another huge plus . The central location is interesting in its own right , and the cinematography fits the film well . Overall , I have to admit that I did enjoy this film ; but it could have been much , much better .
I stumbled on this late last night n TCM . Had n't seen it since it came out originally , but had never forgotten it . I had completely forgotten how gorgeous and talented Signe Hasso was when she was still young , ditto for Shelly Winters before she balooned out . Ronald Coleman , though , was the quintessential state actor of his time - I had read Othello in high school English - and HATED it . After seeing `` A Double Life '' I read it again and finally understood what the play was about . The Gordon/Kanin writing team was at its peak when this script was done - A movie well worth remembering and rewatching ,
I had just reached thirteen when I first saw this series and I am watching it again , on DVD , over thirty years later . The pictures over the opening credits have never left me . It has affected my view of the world and the peoples in it . My parents were with me long enough to have seen the series with me , and we always discussed the programme afterwards . It gave me a love for studying history and the highest marks I got in our school 's public exams ! Sir Laurence Olivier 's voice and delivery is timeless and perfect . I get the feeling that the people who lived through it would feel that this is their version of the history of the Second World War . I can not imagine ever getting bored looking at it . Maybe an similar Cold War series could now be contemplated , although who could replace Sir Laurence is difficult to imagine . Buy it !
I was entranced by this touching and hilarious film , not to mention surprised . I was also surprised to find that the voice of Paulie was performed by Jay Mohr . The performance was so finely nuanced , neither wavering into schmaltz nor becoming too hard under the New Jersey swagger , that I thought that this must be some unsung old pro , not the baby-faced Mr. Mohr . A very impressive performance , indeed , and it 's gratifying to see his talents being taken seriously in a string of quirky , indie films .
OK , I would not normally watch a Farrelly brothers movie . I ca n't recall ever watching one . I also do n't recall watching a Jimmy Fallon movie . Alright , I did watch taxi , but I said penance and was forgiven for that mistake . But , this movie had Drew Barrymore and I just think she is the cutest thing . I do n't know what it is about her , but I just smile the whole time I am watch her . She just captivates me that way . I mean I even watched Adam Sandler just to see her in 50 First Dates . How sad is that ? This was n't the greatest baseball movie - it was n't supposed to be . It was a love story about a sad puppy that hung on to the only thing that never let him down until he found something worth giving that up for . It had a predictable ending , but there was so much on the way there that made it worthwhile .
Animation always seems to be fringe . In Japan , this might not be the case , but in Europe and much more so in the USA animation has a big fat `` KIDS '' tag on it . France is probably one of the more comic-liberal countries , home of classics as Tin-Tin , Asterix , Lucky Luke , Valereon and so on ( if you 've never read these , it 's not too late . There 's no upper-age limit on them and they do n't carry the nerd-stigma of DC or Marvel ) It seems natural a movie like this one pops up in France . It suits my prejudiced image of the French as art-loving , anti-USA-oriented and talented movie-makers . Luckily there 's also `` A scanner darkly '' out there to suppress that view - seems art is pretty much international . Anyway , as you might have gathered Renaissance is artsy and French . If you 're a normal person you will get scared by this . There 's no need for that however ! Beneath it 's cool , sleek cel-shaded appearance there 's a good thriller and a good movie overall . That was one of my fears for this movie . It 's so easy turning the spectacular animation to a gimmick , much like Sony & C : o are doing with their Pixar rip-offs . I was expecting a confusing , sometimes boring and not very engaging movie , but luckily I was wrong . I would have enjoyed it anyway for the neo-noir stuff , but it was good that it was worthwhile on that level as well . NOTE : I 've seen the French dub which was OK as far as I could see . English might be more interesting what with Craig and everything . A final word of praise to the animation . It was awesome . Futuristic , well-crafted , nice camera-work , smart solutions ( Eyes for example looked very good , which is hard to do ) and so visually stunning I felt like bursting out `` This is so damn impressive ! '' . Then again , I really like animation and I appreciate the effort the studio put down , so my verdict is a bit biased . Good movie anyway , definitely lives beyond it 's `` gimmick '' .
This is the kind of film that , if it were made today , it would probably star Sandra Bullock and Hugh Grant ; actually , now that I think about it , this one is quite liable to be remade one day . It 's pleasant , but with no depth whatsoever . It suffers from the almost fatal miscasting of James Stewart in a role he is about 20 years too old for , and as a result there is no chemistry between him and the beautiful Kim Novak . Ernie Kovacs , in the small supporting role of an aspiring writer , is the only actor in the film whose performance approaches what you might call `` wit '' . ( **1/2 )
This is a wonderful new crime series , bringing together three old stalwarts of British television ( Denis Waterman , James Bolam and Alun Armstrong ) as retired detectives brought back to help clear up old cases , under the leadership of younger , career-focused Amanda Redman . The three quirky , irritable old cops make a brilliant team , applying twenty-year old detection methods in a police force which has moved a long way on since then - sometimes with effect , at other times to the horror of their senior officers . The three are portrayed sympathetically , warts and all . There are splendid comic scenes , and some very moving ones as each of the three has to come to terms with growing old and the legacy of their pasts . At the end of the first six-part series ( we are promised a further series next year ) each of the characters had developed . Widower James Bolam can not come to terms with his wife 's untimely death . Lothario Denis Waterman is learning to accept his role as grandfather . And even obsessive Alun Armstrong is helped by his new friends to fight the demons of his past - and keep taking the medication ! While Amanda Redman has to face the all-too-familiar conflict between having a life and a career . The story lines have been interesting , if rather heavily dependent on the wonders of DNA-testing . But it is the interplay of four of Britain 's finest actors which has made the series unmissable .
'How to Lose Friends and Alienate People ' is an entertaining , if loose , adaptation of Toby Young 's memoir of the same name . It 's also a great title for helping to fill up the line requirement in IMDb reviews ! The basic gist is the same as the book with certain incidents dramatised , but a romantic plot is added and the ending is certainly Hollywoodised . Simon Pegg , despite playing an essentially irritating person , is his usual likable and funny self and pretty much carries the film . Strange to think only a few years ago he was just a TV sitcom guy and now he 's rubbing shoulders with Hollywood names . There 's a good supporting cast and it 's an amusing , easy watch - kind of a male 'Ugly Betty ' , but funnier .
Remember the early days of Pay Per View ? I do , and i can almost remember the number you had to CALL to actually rent the movie on your t.v . As a kid we always wanted to rent playboy , but this meant actually calling someone from PPV and asking to rent it . And then you get the nerve to do it and your watching four hours of soft core no angle crap . Well the reason i bring that up is because this movie too was on ppv . And i remember almost every scene that was in the add . I 've been on a kick in the last few years to obtain all the great movies i use to see as a kid and this was one of them . It 's one that when its on its hard to shut off . All star cast trying to commit the perfect bank bust but nothing goes right . There are plenty of spoof bank capers that are good and this one has to fall in that category . It has enough action and laughs to sustain it . check it out if you dare !
It 's a funny business , reviewing movies . These days when `` internalized emotions '' and `` emotional detachment '' are favored over straightforward sentimentality , it must be hard to stay faithful to your true feelings . Soon after completing jury duties at the 58th Berlinale , I managed to catch Yoji Yamada 's Kabei . After the screening , I watched folks dreamily amble out of the theatre hall , watery-eyed , men , women , and reviewers alike . Even the director of the Berlinale , obviously a hardened viewer of cinema , confessed to having been caught unawares and found himself crying three quarter 's way into this unashamedly sentimental experience . But what really surprised me were the reviews that came after . Despite being ineffably moved by the film , many reviewers chose to be tepid and emotionally non-committal in their writing . Apparently , post weeping , they had put on their `` thinking cap '' , and consequently , missed out on what I felt was the genius about Kabei . Allow me to explain . Set in pre-war Japan , the story of Kabei revolves around one writer 's family , and their fate therein , after he is held in jail for what was described as `` thought crimes '' against the Imperial will . Through a series of protracted emotional scenes , Yamada gets us familiar with the man , his loyal wife and two daughters , as well as three side charactersthe man 's pretty young sister , a bumbling ex-student , and a cad of an uncle  all come to help the family cope with their plight , in the absence of the man of the house . The story moves along at a slow albeit steady pace , and heartbreaks occur at precisely the moments everyone is able to predict . This of course makes it near impossible for anyone in the audience to get too emotionally distraught by any dramatic event . In other words , although you learn to love the family and their helpers , and sympathize with their unfortunate situation , you get so lulled by the certainty of the plot that you find yourself expecting a particular kind of ending . However , two hours into the film ( do n't worry , Yamada provides the viewer with sufficient moments of gravity and levity to tide you along ) , he slaps you with what I can only describe as `` the sting '' . All that you have assumed to be what the story was aboutan innocent man wrenched from his faithful wife and daughters  now suddenly points to one of the family helpers . Someone you have hitherto taken for granted is now thrown into an unexpected twist of fate . At this point , something curious happened in the theatre I was in . Everyone started sobbing with little or no inhibition . `` My word ! '' I muttered under my breath . It struck me then that `` Kabei '' , in the final analysis , was more than a film about a family torn apart by an empire on the verge of war . It was , in fact , a cunning examination of one common human foible : How little we cared about the secret feelings of people who are closest to us . Now , the most common criticism made about the film was that it was technically solid , but lacked innovation . That 's what happens when reviewers put on their proverbial thinking cap , I guess . With Kabei , I believe Yoji Yamada knew exactly what trick he was going to employ to touch on one unique aspect of humanity . A wicked old trick he so seamlessly applied in the Tora-san series , and later , in Tasogare Sebei . After lulling the audience into a sort of narrative comfort zone , he throws us into a realm of emotions rarely explored in cinema . This , to me , is the most effective cinematic tool of all . One which avoids detection , but affects you deeply . And proof of its effectiveness was a thousand wet pieces of Kleenex , thrown into a litter bin just outside of that thousand-seater cinema hall . Now if only some reviewers would resist being so caught up with being smart that they forget what cinema is really about . Human emotions . Pure and simple .
This a good episode of The New Twilight Zone that actually includes interesting ideas and clever stories ( I note both of them are based on short stories ) . `` Examination Day '' is set in the future , year unknown but at a point where they have cake candles that light themselves , huge TV-looking `` phones '' that double as numerous other entertaining machines and distributed only to those of a certain age ... and the Examination Day , a point where 12-year-olds must undergo a government-required IQ test . The kid is this story , Dickie Jordan ( David Mendenhall ) is just celebrating his own 12th birthday and is a smart kid , so is calm , even eager to take the test that he has seen friends pass easily and knows he will excel at based on his school grades . His parents ( Christopher Allport and Elizabeth Norment ) , on the other hand , say he should n't have used his birthday wish on getting a good score , and while their reason includes that they believe he 's capable and he should have no need to worry , it 's pretty obvious they are worried . I wo n't give anything away in the ending , but I will say this - there 's a point where we get a glimpse of what 's to come as far ass why the test is such a heavy subject : that evening ( or another ? ) his parents ask Dickie whether he 'd prefer to watch TV all night . By today 's standards , we 'd be pleased he 'd say he 'd rather read and not just because there 's nothing worth watching ... but why would his family ask this ? The flavor of what 's encouraged and discouraged in the future reminded me a bit of the atmosphere from Harrison Bergenon ( which I hear has n't received a great adaptation to the screen ) . I only wish they could 've provided an opening and closing narration to make this theme as powerful as The Obsolete Man was . I found it to be better than the short story it was based on . I have n't read the one that `` A Message from Charity '' was based on , but would like to since it was interesting - a 16-year-ld boy , Peter ( Robert Duncan McNeill ) is suffering a fever from unclean water , that has always been common in his Massachusetts hometown ... but he is able to see through the eyes of a young Puritan woman suffering the same type of fever , Charity Payne , ( Kerry Noonann ) who also finds herself able to experience what goes on around him . They both recover , especially since it 's common for that to happen in 1985 , but the connection does n't go away . Charity is curious about the sights and sounds she records of 1985 and they each enjoy each other 's company , especially Peter , who has promoted grades in school enough to always have felt isolated from other students , even at the college he 's been staying in one place at . Things take an unexpected turn , though , when Charity reveals some of these experiences to a friend who take her claims that the 13 colonies will breach from England as a sign of bewitchment , added to the fact that she was spared death from the fever ( not so common in 1700 ) . The two try to learn a way to save her . The ending is sad but has an interesting final moment that makes it touching . Both segments of this episode include a lot of pain but both times , through a lesson/warning that sounds like something Rod Sterling would 've cooked up and entertainment , make cheerful watching as reminders that friendship , love , and wisdom do a great deal . Probably 3/4 of this has no theme , but somehow I think it all would have been approved by Sterling 's crew .
Homelessness ( or Houselessness as George Carlin stated ) has been an issue for years but never a plan to help those on the street that were once considered human who did everything from going to school , work , or vote for the matter . Most people think of the homeless as just a lost cause while worrying about things such as racism , the war on Iraq , pressuring kids to succeed , technology , the elections , inflation , or worrying if they 'll be next to end up on the streets . But what if you were given a bet to live on the streets for a month without the luxuries you once had from a home , the entertainment sets , a bathroom , pictures on the wall , a computer , and everything you once treasure to see what it 's like to be homeless ? That is Goddard Bolt 's lesson . Mel Brooks ( who directs ) who stars as Bolt plays a rich man who has everything in the world until deciding to make a bet with a sissy rival ( Jeffery Tambor ) to see if he can live in the streets for thirty days without the luxuries ; if Bolt succeeds , he can do what he wants with a future project of making more buildings . The bet 's on where Bolt is thrown on the street with a bracelet on his leg to monitor his every move where he ca n't step off the sidewalk . He 's given the nickname Pepto by a vagrant after it 's written on his forehead where Bolt meets other characters including a woman by the name of Molly ( Lesley Ann Warren ) an ex-dancer who got divorce before losing her home , and her pals Sailor ( Howard Morris ) and Fumes ( Teddy Wilson ) who are already used to the streets . They 're survivors . Bolt is n't . He 's not used to reaching mutual agreements like he once did when being rich where it 's fight or flight , kill or be killed . While the love connection between Molly and Bolt was n't necessary to plot , I found `` Life Stinks '' to be one of Mel Brooks ' observant films where prior to being a comedy , it shows a tender side compared to his slapstick work such as Blazing Saddles , Young Frankenstein , or Spaceballs for the matter , to show what it 's like having something valuable before losing it the next day or on the other hand making a stupid bet like all rich people do when they do n't know what to do with their money . Maybe they should give it to the homeless instead of using it like Monopoly money . Or maybe this film will inspire you to help others .
Kudos to Fawcett to taking on roles that , at the time were considered controversial . To my recollection , rape was still a taboo subject in the 1980 's , and women 's rights and emotions were rarely so deeply examined during that time . Fawcett is simply a woman who is followed , then stalked by actor James Russo . He is adequate as the obsessed psychopath , but at times a bit transparent . Diana Scarwid has a bit role , as does Alfre Woodard as the house mate . Woodard worries about the legal consequences when Fawcett , the rape victim , takes revenge on the culprit . The scene where she throws a frying pan of hot oil at Russo is classic , and as the rapist he deserves it . She then keeps him in bondage , and the consequences must be faced . A very real story reflecting the emotions and rage of rape victims who have been violated , physically , and mentally . Highly recommended . 8/10 .
Rawhide was a wonderful TV western series . Focusing on a band of trail drovers lead by the trail boss Gil Favor . Most episodes - especially from the first 3 seasons were really character studies of Favor and his men . Guest stars came and went but unlike Wagon Train they seldom dominated the episodes they appeared in . Rawhide was a true , gritty western and Gil Favor stood out as a memorable character never to be forgotten . Thanks to Eric Fleming 's performance the show became a massive hit . Of course he was ably supported by a wonderful cast of good actors - Clint Eastwood , Sheb Wooley , Paul Brinegar , Steve Raines , James Murdoch , Rocky Shahan , Robert Cabal . All of these actors left their mark in a piece of television history . Rawhide captured the flavour of that time of the west that no other series has for me , as yet anyhow , managed to do so . Later seasons tended to split the leads and give them individual story lines . For me some of the time this did n't work - the cattle drive and the regulars provided the best stories . However there were still some classic stories and Rawhide remained top drawer affair . The black and white photography added to a bleak , realistic feel that other western series seldom managed to capture . Rustlers , Indians , Commancheroes , beautiful damsels in distress , serial killers , they all showed up to give our heroes problems . The end came for the series quietly when the final season was axed less than half way through . The reason - Eric Fleming had departed and Rawhide was now a head without a body - the gritty realism was gone , Gil Favor commanded respect and exuded authority - he was never infallible and this made him all the more interesting . We shall not see his like again . Watch an episode whenever you can , they seldom disappoint .
An American in Paris was , in many ways , the ultimate mixture of art and Hollywood musical . Made at the height of MGM 's powers as a musical powerhouse , the film features memorable music from the Gershwins , who rightly have been called the 20th Century 's equivalent of Beethoven and Mozart . Gene Kelly was also at the height of his powers in this film , though it could be rightly argued that this movie was just the warm-up for his best work in Singin ' in the Rain ( 1952 ) . The two films are actually closely linked . Aside from the Arthur Freed connection , the Broadway Melody segment in `` Rain '' owes its existence to the incredible American in Paris Ballet sequence in this film . This might well have been the only time a dance number is specially mentioned in the opening credits of the film . And it deserved to be , as it showcases Gene Kelly 's skills as a dancer and choreographer to their utmost degree . The film 's cast is uniformly excellent . Leslie Caron , incredibly making her film debut , shows a maturity that makes you think she 'd been making films for years . Her introductory dance sequence , and later her work on the Ballet , provides some surprisingly sexy moments rivalled in MGM Musicals only by Cyd Charisse 's work in Singin ' in the Rain and The Band Wagon . Oscar Levant is hilarious as Kelly 's stoic pal , who gets two of the film 's best moments : during the end party sequence ( which I will not give away for anyone who has n't seen the film ) , and one of the film 's most memorable musical numbers which couples his incredible piano skills with state-of-the-art ( for the time ) special effects . Less memorable are Georges Guetary as Kelly 's romantic rival , though he does get a few musical highlights , and Nina Foch as Leslie Caron 's romantic rival . The May-December relationship between Kelly 's character and Nina 's reminded me of the same `` kept man '' relationship seen between George Peppard and Patricia Neal in Breakfast at Tiffany 's . There are a few elements of the film that made it less satisfying for me than Singin ' in the Rain . The Ballet , though lavish and well-produced , does n't really fit with the rest of the movie . Without giving away the plot , the Ballet just happens , with no real rhyme or reason . And unlike the Broadway Melody sequence , it really does n't have anything to do with the plot -- and in the best musicals , the songs always have some sort of raison d'etre . Making matters worse is the ending of the film which happens immediately after the Ballet . Although the ending should n't be a surprise ( this IS an MGM musical , after all ) , I was hoping for a bit more ... movie after the Ballet ended . It 's as if director Vincente Minnelli felt that he could n't follow the Ballet with anything else . The film literally left me in the lurch . That negative aside , An American in Paris rightly ranks alongside the best of Hollywood 's musicals . It does n't quite reach the heights of Singin ' in the Rain , but it comes close and it remains a testament to Gene Kelly 's skills as one of the greatest dancers of all time .
I was very pleased to go and see a `` Milanese '' film shot in Milan . Alessandro Alatri is a Roman director who has understood properly and fortunately printed in a film the Milanese philosophy . Film tells the story of a standard -in career- Milanese couple , starting from `` the birth '' to the death . The birth-wedding is so typical out of any scheme that becomes original and involves all the wedding guests in a flash back story of how the couple came to each other and felt in love . Life is hard in the `` urbe '' of Milan and after the sweeties old days became tougher and tougher , then finally the product : a child , who instead of strengthen further the couple relationship it weaken because `` the selfish effect '' typical of a nowadays `` metropolis '' personality . The advertising environment with all the `` creative '' under stress atmosphere helps to get well involved in the plot . We are losing the life values and this is well and deeply reflected in this nice and sharp movie from the Senza Pelle 's director . The actors are well chosen , Stefania Rocca nice and well characterised , and a positive surprise , an unexpected good Fabio Volo , well known by the `` trash '' TV serie : Le Iene . Rating : 7/10
The Sopranos is probably the most widely acclaimed TV series ever , so naturally my expectations were through the roof , and yet the show surpassed them . I love the mafia and crime genre in film and I enjoy following the compelling stories set in these worlds , but this is so much more . 86+ hours of material gives the story a chance to not only be one of the most thrilling and unpredictable mafia/action stories , but also to be a great family drama , a shocking character study , a laugh-out-loud comedy , a brilliant psychological examination dealing with the nature of good and evil , and an intellectual arty collaboration of representative dreams and hallucinations all in one . David Chase 's epic series manages to accomplish all of this and more , and cements HBO as the closest TV can get to cinematic perfection , paving the road for a number of other series to continue blowing audiences away . Realism is present when it is needed , but Chase 's decisions to depart from it for effect on occasion for `` dream episodes '' and the like only adds more layers to the series . Chase -- along with a strong writing staff including Matthew Weiner and Terrence Winter , future creators of Mad Men and Boardwalk Empire respectively -- turns New Jersey into an intricate universe full of the greatest cast of characters I 've seen on TV . James Gandolfini domineers the show as Tony , one of the most groundbreaking characters on TV ever . Tony adheres to half of the mobster stereotypes from pop culture , but he defies the other half entirely , and through his family interactions and his therapy sessions with Dr. Melfi ( Lorraine Bracco , with whom he has a considerable chemistry that ensures that the therapy scenes always have a completely different feel to the rest of the show ) , we see nearly every side to Tony Soprano and learn that he is more of an everyman than one would expect . Edie Falco matches the power of Gandolfini 's performance as Tony 's wife Carmela . From her mixed feelings about Tony 's lifestyle , to her suspicions about murders , to her torment over Tony 's cheating , to her own thoughts about infidelity , Carmela runs the gamut of emotions throughout 6 seasons and Falco makes her the prime vehicle for the non- mafia viewers to have eyes into such a corrupt world . Scenes between Tony and Carmela provide some of the most heartwrenching and painfully realistic drama ever seen on television . The supporting cast is almost as phenomenal , and a wide array of characters populate the cast over all six seasons , somehow without any redundancies . Nancy Marchand steals the show as Tony 's overbearing mother Livia , an insight into Tony 's personality problems and panic attacks . The familiarity of Marchand 's incessant complaints is almost gruesome since she takes the character so believably far . Michael Imperioli is Christopher , Tony 's protégé , whose various poor choices lead him down a road that is painful to watch but brilliantly executed . Drea De Matteo plays Christopher 's girlfriend Adriana , and is so well- meaning and loving that the dark arc her character takes as she gets too involved with Christopher 's career . Tony Sirico is Paulie , introduced as the ultimate mafia stereotype and a source of comic , but eventually he becomes one of the most sympathetic and complex characters on the show , and nobody plays true anger better than he . And that 's just the tip of the iceberg . Familiar faces such as Peter Bogdanovich , Jon Favreau , Ben Kingsley , Lauren Bacall , Will Arnett , Nancy Sinatra , David Strathairn , Robert Patrick , Hal Holbrook , Burt Young , and Eric Mangini make appearances over the course of the show , while names as notable as Joe Pantoliano , Steve Buscemi , and Steven Van Zandt have regular roles as main characters in the series . There are 50+ great characters with powerful arcs , and the excitement and tension never let up in any of the various subplots throughout the show . Comedic elements and entire episodes filled with brilliant hilarity dilute the powerhouse dramatic intensity of the series , which is so multipurpose that for one reason or enough , the credits of nearly any episode left me somewhat bewildered . The Sopranos is the most powerful and addicting series I have seen overall , and its highs are so mindblowing that I would have to call it my favourite show in spite of arguable lows ( most of which I disagree with ) . Whether you love or hate the ending , or what you make of it is irrelevant : the discussion it has created is an achievement in itself . The iconic nature of the entire series makes it an essential part of television history . There are multiple elements for anyone to love and marvel at in this show , so if you 're thinking of watching something else instead , do yourself a favour and fuhgeddaboutit .
I heard tell that Madonna was briefly considered for the Catherine Tremell role . Compared to Sharon Stone , Madonna is too coarse and BAUERISCH . She 's not even close . EVIL INCARNATE : Sharon Stone is a bit long in the tooth , the ameliorative effects of modern chemistry and surgery notwithstanding . However , she artfully treats us to a frightening personification of evil beyond redemption . In the obligatory sex scene , she projects pure , crystalline lust . Especially her hooded , luminous eyes and a face flat with pleasure . Thanks to brilliant use of lighting and other stage techniques , the harsh lines of age are only occasionally manifest . Rather , she seems to have a slight golden glow ( YES , YEATS ) . The locations gave us a view of London that is a welcome departure from the usual Londonscapes .The Catherine character is so powerful and menacing that I thank my lucky stars that our paths never crossed . I would n't have had a chance . THE ORIGINAL BASIC INSTINCT ; ATTEMPTS AT CENSORSHIP : I must briefly comment on the original 1992 film , set in San Francisco , a beautiful city worthy of this film . It is outstanding , from the music to the locations to the sets , and so on . Paul Verhoven pulled striking performances out of the cast and crew . That the main Baddie was a woman did not escape the scrutiny of Bay Area Gay and Lesbian activist groups . Attempts at censorship were vehemently denied . SWELL . These philosophical pygmies demanded editorial control over the script , insisting on re-writes that would promote their political and psychiatrically driven agendas . Example : Sanctimoniously alleging sexism and misogyny , they demanded that the lead role be switched from BAD GIRL to BAD GUY . On locations in San Francisco , the gentle , tolerant activists did their best to sabotage filming of the scenes with noise , flashing lights and other tactics . The Executive Producers , Mario Kassar and Andrew Vajna , vowed to fight any efforts to restrict the artistic freedom guaranteed in our democracy and obtained restraining orders against the disruptive tactics . BLOWBACK : Thanks to the fulminating activists , the film got huge national press coverage - millions of dollars worth of free advertising . Their calls for viewers to boycott the film resulted in a backlash that had customers waiting in long lines wherever the film was launched . It also received widespread critical acclaim . It was , in the words of the reptilian Hackett in NETWORK , `` A BIG- TITTED HIT ! '' Sorry , Gentle Reader ; I just could n't resist that one . Yes , it 's a gibe . In conclusion , I believe that both BASIC INSTINCT 1 AND 2 , with their brilliant musical scores , aesthetics and acting , are works of art that deserve protection under our Constitution .
I went to see this movie expecting a nice relaxing time in the theater with my younger sister . Instead , I had to really control myself in order to convince her that I was not scared . In many ways still a children´s story , but with a screenplay that has a lot of potential . Could have been one of the scariest movies if planned for another audience .
Please see also my comment on Die Nibelungen part 1 : Siegfried . The second part of UFA studio 's gargantuan production of the Nibelungen saga continues in the stylised , symphonic and emotionally detached manner of its predecessor . However , whereas part one was a passionless portrayal of individual acts of heroism , part two is a chaotic depiction of bloodletting on a grand scale . As in part one , director Fritz Lang maintains a continuous dynamic rhythm , with the pace of the action and the complexity of the shot composition rising and falling smoothly as the tone of each scene demands . These pictures should only be watched with the note-perfect Gottfried Huppertz score , which fortunately is on the Kino DVD . Now , with this focus on mass action , Lang is presented with greater challenges in staging . The action sequences in his earliest features were often badly constructed , but now he simply makes them part of that rhythmic flow , with the level of activity on the screen swelling up like an orchestra . But just as part one made us witness Siegfried 's adventures matter-of-factly and without excitement , part two presents warfare as devastating tragedy . In both pictures , there is a deliberate lack of emotional connection with the characters . That 's why Lang mostly keeps the camera outside of the action , never allowing us to feel as if we are there ( and this is significant because involving the audience is normally a distinction of Lang 's work ) . That 's also why the performances are unnaturally theatrical , with the actors lurching around like constipated sleepwalkers . Nevertheless , Kriemhild 's revenge does constantly deal with emotions , and is in fact profoundly humanist . The one moment of naturalism is when Atilla holds his baby son for the first time , and Lang actually emphasises the tenderness of this scene by building up to it with the wild , frantic ride of the huns . The point is that Lang never manipulates us into taking sides , and in that respect this version has more in common with the original saga than the Wagner opera . The climactic slaughter is the very antithesis of a rousing battle scene . Why then did Hitler and co. get so teary-eyed over it , a fact which has unfairly tarnished the reputation of these films ? Because the unwavering racial ideology of the Nazis made them automatically view the Nibelungs as the good guys , even if they do kill babies and betray their own kin . For Hitler , their downfall would always be a nationalist tragedy , not a human one . But for us non-nazi viewers , what makes this picture enjoyable is its beautiful sense of pageantry and musical rhythm . When you see these fully-developed silent pictures of Lang 's , it makes you realise how much he was wasted in Hollywood . Rather than saddling him with low-budget potboilers , they should have put him to work on a few of those sword-and-sandal epics , pictures that do not have to be believable and do not have to move us emotionally , where it 's the poetic , operatic tonality that sweeps us along .
In the periphery of São Paulo , the very low middle-class dysfunctional and hypocrite family of Teodoro ( Giulio Lopes ) , Cláudia ( Leona Cavalli ) and the teenager Soninha ( Sílvia Lourenço ) have deep secrets . The religious Teodoro is indeed a hit-man , hired to kill people in the neighborhood with his friend Waldomiro ( Ailton Graça ) . He has a lover , the very devout woman Terezinha ( Martha Meola ) , and he wants to regenerate , going to the country with her . Cláudia has a young lover , Júlio ( Ismael de Araújo ) , who delivers meats for his father 's butcher shop . Soninha is a common sixteen years old teenager of the periphery , having active sexual life , smoking grass and loving heavy metal . When Júlio is killed and castrated in their neighborhood , the lives of the members of the family change . `` Contra Todos '' is a great low budget Brazilian movie that pictures the life in the periphery of a big Brazilian city . The story is very real , uses the usual elements of the poor area of the big Brazilian cities ( drug dealers , hit men , fanatic religious evangelic people , hopeless teenagers etc . ) , has many plot points and a surprising end , and the characters have excellent performances , acting very natural and making the story totally believable . The camera follows the characters , giving a great dynamics to the film . In the Extras of the DVD , the director Roberto Moreira explains that his screenplay had no lines , only the description of the situations , and was partially disclosed only one week before the beginning of the shootings . The actors have trainings in workshops and they used lots of improvisation , being the reason for such natural acting . My vote is eight . Title ( Brazil ) : `` Contra Todos '' ( `` Against Everybody '' )
It could have been a better film . It does drag at points , and the central story shifts from Boyer completing his mission to Boyer avenging Wanda Hendrix 's death , but Graham Greene is an author who is really hard to spoil . His stories are all morality tales , due to his own considerations of Catholicism , guilt and innocence ( very relative terms in his world view ) , and the human condition . Boyer is Luis Denard , a well-known concert pianist , who has sided with the Republicans in the Spanish Civil War . He has been sent to England to try to carry through an arms purchase deal that is desperately needed . Unfortunately for Denard he is literally on his own - everyone of his contacts turns out to be a willing turncoat for the Falagists of Spain . In particular Katina Paxinou ( Mrs. Melendez ) a grim boarding house keeper , and Peter Lorre ( Mr. Contreras ) a teacher of an `` esperanto '' type international language . Wanda Hendrix is the drudge of a girl ( Else ) who works for Mrs. Melendez . The local diplomat , Licata ( Victor Francken ) is already a willing associate of the Falangists . The Brits ( Holmes Herbert , Miles Mander , and best - if not worst - of the lot , George Coulouris ) do n't give much hope to Boyer 's cause ( which he soon grasps may be Britain 's before long ) . Herbert and Mander just retreat behind the official policy of neutrality ordered by the Ramsay MacDonald 's and Stanley Baldwin 's governments during the Civil War . Coulouris here is a typical Col. Blimp type - always impeccable in his native English diction , he is sharp in showing his dislike for foreigners in general . The one ray of hope is Lauren Bacall ( Rose Cullen ) , here trying to play her role as well as she can - but she ca n't really . She 's an aristocrat - the daughter of a Press lord . It was Bacall 's second film , and ( sad to say ) almost sank her long career . She does act well , but the spark she showed in her first film was due to the dual effect of starring with Humphrey Bogart and being directed by Howard Hawks . Boyer is a fine actor , but he 's not Bogie , and Herman Shumlin is not Hawks . Her next film returned her to Bogie and Hawks again , and her star resumed it 's ascendancy . It 's a bleak film ( as was the novel ) . Boyer 's mission never succeeds , as he has too many hidden foes all over the place . But the villains are likewise also losers - frequently with their lives . With Dan Seymour as a suspicious foreign tenant of Katina Paxinou ( and the man who destroys her ) . It is well worth watching to catch the Warner 's lot of character actors doing their best given the weakness in direction .
I saw this movie once on late night t.v . and knew it was the best movie ever . This is one of the few Kung-Fu movies with a decent plot . The progression of the main character is seamless . The whole movie is great !
but I want to say I can not agree more with Moira . What a wonderful film . I was thinking about it just this morning , wanting to give advice to some dopey sod who 'd lost money on his debit card through fraud , and wanted to say 'Keep thy money in thine pocket ' and realised I was talking like James Mason . Even tho he did n't say those words , I still think he would ! I 've never forgotten 'Are ye carrying ? ' in his reconciliation with his son , Hywel Bennet : 'Always have money in thine pocket ! ' Good advice . Not enough kids have fathers with such unforgiving but well-meant attitudes any more . Or any father at all . It would be a good thing for us to reinstate 'thee ' , 'thy ' and 'thine ' in our language to show we care . It is only the same as 'tutoyer ' in French or 'du ' in German . Addendum : I just realised that a lot of my remarks were about James Mason in The Family Way ! I think it 's because I mixed up Susan George with Hayley Mills . Well , easy mistake . I stand by the comments tho ' . And Spring and Port Wine is so very similar to The Family Way . When you took a girlfriend to the pictures in those days , you really had something to say and talk about afterwards , something that affected your knowledge of the world and your personal development . Theatrical experiences are almost real , and they are important in helping young people to grow up . It does n't happen now , I think , that teenagers can just go to the pics like we did .
Handsome and dashing British airline pilot George Taylor ( a solid portrayal by Guiseppe Pambieri ) gets beat up by thugs after a wild night in Hong Kong . George meets and falls in love with the sweet and virginal Dr. Emy Wong ( a fine and charming performance by the lovely Chai Lee ) . George regains his health and goes back to work . When Emy fails to hear from George for a lengthy amount of time , she succumbs to despair and becomes a prostitute . While director/co-writer Bitto Albertini does indeed deliver a satisfying amount of the expected tasty nudity and steamy soft-core sex , this film is anything but your routine wallow in leering sleaze . Instead it 's a surprisingly thoughtful , touching and tragic love story between two well drawn and highly appealing characters ( Chai as Emy Wong is especially radiant and endearing ) . The picture starts out bubbly and cheerful , but the tone radically shifts into a more grim and harsh mood about two thirds of the way through . Emy 's descent into vice after she falsely assumes that George has abandoned her is bleak and upsetting ; ditto the remarkably sad and heartbreaking surprise bummer ending . Granted , the narrative is certainly melodramatic , but never too silly or trashy . Moreover , the sex scenes are quite tasteful and even genuinely erotic . Notorious Italian porn star Ilona Staller has a nice sizable supporting part as George 's jealous and uninhibited secretary Helen Miller . Guido Mancori 's polished cinematography offers many strikingly gorgeous shots of the exotic locations . Nico Fidenco 's funky , throbbing score hits the groovy spot . Worth a look for those seeking something different .
After growing up in the gritty streets of Detroit , MI , and having friends who traveled to New York balls , I fell into the lifestyle of being a House member . I joined the House of Theieves . We adapted the same rules as most houses , but we were professional crooks that would boost and commit credit card fraud to obtain the fabulous jewels and clothes we desired . I even learned how to profess the making of checks and driver 's license and cash them in over seventeen states , until a jealous queen called the Secret Service on me and I went to Federal prison . But , I learned a lot from these queens in this movie and I highly recommend you watch it yourself . You can even read about how I grew up in the houses here in Detroit and the criminal activity we indulged in . My book , Identity Schemes is available on sale at Amazon dot com or at Identity Schemes dot com . But trust me , It is a lot better than Paris is Burning , because its a 2005 make .
Ask yourself where she got the gun ? Remember what she was taught about the mark 's mindset when the con is over ? The gun had blanks and it was provided to her from the very beginning . When the patient comes back at the end she was SUPPOSED to see him drive away in the red convertible and lead her to the gang splitting up her 80 thousand . The patient was in on the con from the beginning . Mantegna does not die in the end - the gun had blanks . There - enough spoilers for you there ? This is why people are giving it such high ratings . It 's extremely original because of the hidden ending and how it cons MOST of the audience .
Being an Austrian myself this has been a straight knock in my face . Fortunately I do n't live nowhere near the place where this movie takes place but unfortunately it portrays everything that the rest of Austria hates about Viennese people ( or people close to that region ) . And it is very easy to read that this is exactly the directors intention : to let your head sink into your hands and say `` Oh my god , how can THAT be possible ! '' . No , not with me , the ( in my opinion ) totally exaggerated uncensored swinger club scene is not necessary , I watch porn , sure , but in this context I was rather disgusted than put in the right context . This movie tells a story about how misled people who suffer from lack of education or bad company try to survive and live in a world of redundancy and boring horizons . A girl who is treated like a whore by her super-jealous boyfriend ( and still keeps coming back ) , a female teacher who discovers her masochism by putting the life of her super-cruel `` lover '' on the line , an old couple who has an almost mathematical daily cycle ( she is the `` official replacement '' of his ex wife ) , a couple that has just divorced and has the ex husband suffer under the acts of his former wife obviously having a relationship with her masseuse and finally a crazy hitchhiker who asks her drivers the most unusual questions and stretches their nerves by just being super-annoying . After having seen it you feel almost nothing . You 're not even shocked , sad , depressed or feel like doing anything ... Maybe that 's why I gave it 7 points , it made me react in a way I never reacted before . If that 's good or bad is up to you !
Although Cinderella is n't the obvious choice for a sequel I love Jaq and Gus so I did n't hesitate . The format of the mice writing a book for Cinderella was an inspired one . I enjoy writing stories myself and hope children will be encouraged by this . The three stories are cute & amusing , although the songs were forgettable . Jaq and Gus were my favourite characters but I also enjoyed seeing Lucifer , Bruno , the Mice Chorus and all the rest . Pom Pom proved the perfect companion for Lucifer and I liked the Governess . A sequel done right for a change . My rating 8/10 .
The movie starts off in a classroom setting where not surprisingly , our main actress , Orked was seen in a Chinese Language class . Later in the film , she was asked on why ( by Mukhsin ) that she was sent to learn Mandarin . Her answer was simple for a child she is ; coz she 's already known the Malay Language well . It 's a bit of a romance one may thought of it , but once you 've stopped yourself from reading too much critics and go for it , you 'll notice the typical elements of Malaysia . The movie basically focuses on 10 year old Orked who met 12 year old Mukhsin in a game of which many would think of it as a boy 's game . Running out of players , Mukhsin ( who was new in that village ) was forced to allow Orked into the game , in which she eagerly showed the male side of her . Orked is no such ordinary girl as she depicts more of the male behavior as you will see in the movie , defending Mukhsin from much violent encounter with her school-bullies , throwing one of the bully 's bag out from the school bus window , throwing punches and kicks on Mukhsin 's brother where after he teased Mukhsin and so on and so forth . Both were awesome buddies , and stick closer than that , but with a slightest of misunderstanding in which most of us would all respond to in the same way , parted the both of them until the day when Mukhsin left town . Now the movie depicts the first love between Orked and Mukhsin , they started out as friends , but slowly evolving into somewhat more of a closer relationship and then towards BGR . You would notice , the changes Yasmin made in the movies for each of the main actor and the actress when they go through love . The different character was portrayed with eagerness and mild humor . The scenes were all in random but it depicted so much reality in it that you 'd be stuck on the screen for a long time . You will love the movie for what it is , and not because that you want to be patriotic to the local scenes , coz it means much more . As the movie envelopes around the two love birds , it also manages to find its lens towards Orked 's parents , her mother who was educated in England , speaks very good English and in which , her husband and the caretaker in the house with very much attempt tries to speak back their own kind of English , which was humor all the way indeed . Let me just explain to you why humor can be such a prominent thing in this movie . And that explanation or description that you may portray can be given in only one word and that is RANDOMNESS . Often more than not , we do n't learn to laugh at ourselves , and when we do , we do it at the expense of others . It is just like what the movie Just Follow Law by Jack Neo would have mentioned - Often when we are ourselves , we do n't see the person in us we are , but when only when we are in another person 's body , then only would we learn to see who we really are . And that is how humor applies as well , more so than just dignity . The movie was filled with such randomness that the typical facts of our routine lives as we carried it out could be all the way filled with laughter if we want it to be . The other focus of this movie was on how Orked 's neighbor , a couple in which the husband is no longer loving to his wife , and wanted to find another . Pak Koboi as what he 's nicked after was seen polishing his motorbike daily and would take it out for a ride with his newly found girlfriend . The producer did not fail to show you perhaps why the husband wanted to find another wife . The wife was a real hurler or KPC as we Chinese would call it , having interrupting on other people 's business and sending her own daughter to tease Orked in words only adults would use . After all , what goes around , comes around , and that 's probably why bad things kinda want to happen to her . In every time , being nice to people around you wo n't hurt at all , unless you have an ego to protect , but then again , what 's it worth ? The movie also centers around Mukhsin 's brother , Hussein who would go out to town everyday until very late at night , smoking , drinking , and also finding 'girls ' . He 's the total opposite of Mukhsin , but that 's all perhaps because of family problems . Both the brothers were staying with their aunt and the parents were far away from them . I will not reveal more of the story line as it would spoil much of the interest in wanting to find it out for yourself , but the slightest of all elements in which the producer wanted to send a message across to the viewers is the life of us all . She wanted us , me at least to view life from our own perspective when we are not ourselves . Movies in a way , take us out from our own body , places us in the character 's position , and use our empty mind then to view on the happenings of it . Depending on the type and genre of the movie , you will be mesmerized by how a good movie such as this would portray and imply a significant impact on you .
` Castle of Blood ' ( aka ` Castle of Terror ' ) is a well-crafted , surprisingly spooky entry from Italian director Anthony Dawson . Exquisite black and white cinematography , flawless dubbing , superb casting , fairly logical scripting , deliberate pacing and a surprise ( though totally appropriate ) ending set this one apart . Only the films sometimes hokey music and the rather abrupt ` love at first sight ' between Elizabeth ( Barbara Steele ) and Alan ( Georges Rivière ) mar an otherwise surprisingly entertaining movie . While visiting England , Edgar Allan Poe sits in a pub , telling one of his ghostly stories to Count Blackwood . Recognizing the great writer , Alan , a young news reporter , requests an interview with Poe . During the course of the conversation , Poe reveals that all of his stories are true . Incredulous , Alan expresses his skepticism about life after death . Count Blackwood offers to bet Alan 100 pounds that he can not survive this night in Blackwood 's castle , a night following Halloween when the dead walk . Alan can not afford the bet , so he bets his life for a 10 pound wager . Unlike Mario Bava 's overpraised ` Black Sunday , ' ( aka ` The Mask of Satan ' ) , ` Castle of Blood ' is fairly restrained , making the few moments of violence even more dreadful , especially surprising from a director usually associated with those terrible Italian space movies from the 60s . It 's a pity the only version of this film I 've found is badly deteriorated ( and recorded ) pan and scan version . Even so , it is well worth seeing , and cries out for a modern remake , perhaps with Christina Ricci or Jennifer Love Hewitt in the role of Elizabeth . Watch it and enjoy a film that compares well with Robert Wise 's ` The Haunting ' .
Jim Carrey is back to much the same role that he played in The Mask , a timid guy who is trying to get ahead in the world but who seems to be plagued with bad luck . Even when he tries to help a homeless guy from being harassed by a bunch of hoodlums ( and of course they have to be Mexican , obviously ) , his good will towards his fellow man backfires . In that case , it was n't too hard to predict that he was about to have a handful of angry hoodlums , but I like that the movie suggests that things like that should n't be ignored . I 'm reminded of the episode of Michael Moore 's brilliant The Awful Truth , when they had a man lay down on the sidewalk and pretend to be dead and see who would actually stop and make sure he was okay . The results were not very promising , so it 's nice to see someone in the movies setting a good example . Jim Carrey plays the part of Bruce Nolan , the nice guy mentioned above whose entire life seems to be falling apart . Or even better , it seems to be breaking up by the blows of bad luck like an asteroid entering the atmosphere ( a little metaphor that comes up when Bruce miraculously finds himself a gigantic news story later in the film ) . Bruce is nearly 40 years old and all he has to show for it is a position as a news reporter of the sort that reports on such exciting news as the local bakery that 's seeking to bake the world 's biggest cookie . He 's desperate to obtain the job of head anchor at the TV station , but he loses his cool on live TV when he hears that the job went to his rival colleague . You have to love how they time the revelation of this news to him seconds before his first live report . Needless to say , he loses his temper on live TV in one of the funniest scenes of the entire film . Morgan Freeman delivers a fantastic performance as the Man himself , displaying a God whose infinite wisdom is somewhat reflected through Freeman 's massive talent as an actor . He is the kind of God who takes his job very seriously , but in such a way as to advise his followers ( as well as the viewers of this movie ) that there are times when you need to slow down and do some manual labor in life . I love his line that some of the happiest people in the world come home smelling to high heaven at the end of the day . There are a lot of people in the world ( maybe more than our share in America ) who are so absorbed by their money and their possessions and their jobs and everything that they completely lost touch with the natural side of themselves as humans . One of the biggest strengths is that the movie is able to provide great advice to people in general about improving their lives , and this message is clear and acceptable regardless of the viewer 's religion . I , for example , tend to reject organized religion in all forms and I see God and Satan to be metaphors for different aspects of nature and human psychology rather than actual figures who ever lived or continue to live . But despite the fact that I do n't believe that God exists as an entity overseeing the universe or as a janitor dressed all in white who mops the floors of his downtown office in his spare time , I was able to appreciate the messages that were delivered in this movie . Jim Carrey 's movies display this fantastic evolution that ties them all together and makes the newer ones look even better just because you can see how far he 's come . If you compare Bruce Almighty with movies like Ace Ventura ( both of which I loved , by the way ) or a lot of what he did before he got into film , it 's amazing how far he 's come . He has moved from cheesy TV comedy to cheesy comedic films to comedies that are truly intelligent and meaningful like this film as well as others like The Truman Show , Man on the Moon , and The Majestic ( easily one of his greatest films ever ) . Jim Carrey has unmistakably moved from the cheesy comedy of his past to become one of the most important comic actors working today . Jennifer Aniston also once again provides an excellent addition to the movie ( as she did in the side-splitting Office Space ) as Bruce 's girlfriend , who becomes increasingly exasperated by Bruce 's growing stress about his life as well as his negligence to ask her to marry him . There is definitely some low-brow comedy in the film that does n't really fit with the importance of the film 's meaning or the quality of the delivery , such as the dog reading the newspaper on the toilet and the whole monkey scene , but it was definitely pretty nice to see Ace Ventura 's friend Spike make a cameo appearance . As Stephen King very well knows , it 's always nice to see familiar characters . It 's almost like seeing family again . Bruce is endowed with the powers of God for a given period of time so that he can understand life a bit better , and he says a lot about himself when he uses the powers only for his own purposes rather than to help all of the people who pray to him . The thing I love about this is that , like I said before , religion is absent from my life , but I was able to watch this and learn a lot about myself as well by thinking about what kinds of things I would have done had I been endowed with such powers . The movie allows us to learn vicariously this way , which empowers the message even more . The scenes that involve the news station are easily the funniest in the entire film , such as the scene when Bruce loses his temper about the anchor position , the Jimmy Hoffa scene ( who was conveniently buried with an original birth certificate and a complete set of dental records ) , the scene where Bruce 's rival colleague is made to go nuts on camera , and my favorites , the ones at the beginning and the end involving the local bakery 's cooking . The movie has plenty of time for Carrey to deliver some excellent jokes , such as when he says to God ( who reveals that he 's the janitor , the proprietor , the electrician , etc ) that his Christmas parties must be real bashes , and to be careful about drinking , because on of him might need a ride home ! I also loved the end when he says that behind every great man is a woman rolling her eyes . A little too true , and as Gallagher would add , behind every great man is also an amazed mother-in-law . Bruce Almighty is one of the more memorable comedies to have come out for quite a while , and is probably the only directly religious that I can remember seeing that I am anxious to buy on DVD to add to my personal collection . It is a comedy written and performed in good taste , but with enough relatively low-brow humor to keep the kids entertained . This is a meaningful comedy for the whole family , which is becoming rarer and rarer these days . In a world that is about to be flogged with yet another American Pie film AND another Scary Movie ( which are only scary because of their sheer barbarous idiocy ) , it 's nice to see that there are still people making comedies worth watching . Do n't miss this one .
This is an excellent movie . As a Canadian who grew up with a rural lifestyle much of it is familiar , the winter , canoeing , trapping , hunting and the like . It is easy to take the familiar for granted but after watching this film a few times it has grown on me . The story of Grey Owl is well known to many Canadians credit to director Attenborough and screenplay writer Nicholson for expanding the story . Brosnan does well portraying a complex man , a very fine performance . Annie Galipeau is lovely in her first large role . The rest of the cast is solid .
When it comes to creating a universe George Lucas is the undisputed master and his final Star Wars film is very , very good ( and more appropriately rated in comparison to the two previous films in the original saga ) . Having recently seen Revenge of the Sith really puts this movie in perspective . The final battle seems even more climactic knowing what Anakin Skywalker went through at the manipulative hands of the Emperor . It also makes the final battle between Luke and Vader more bitter considering the love he felt for Padmé and the love she felt for her children . Actually while the new films ( especially Episode II ) are inferior to the original films they are good for one reason only . They make the old films seem even better . Mark Hamill does an exceptional job in this movie . He really brings the changes Luke has gone through seem real . In all fairness I believe that he should have become a big actor based on these films because he really does a great job . Harrison Ford is still good . However , you can feel that he has done Raiders and Blade Runner in between the two final chapters of Star Wars because he seems to have grown quite a bit . He adds more comedy ( obviously inspired from Raiders ) to the character which works brilliantly . In short Han Solo is better than ever . Carrie Fisher was never really a good actress but she does a decent job and is certainly passable . Ian McDiarmid appears in this film and having seen Episode III I can safely say that he is one of the most accomplished villains ever . James Earl Jones still provides the voice for Vader and he is still very , very good . In terms of how the movie looks its pretty safe to say that the Star Wars universe looks better than in either of the previous ( two ) movies but this was always Lucas ' forté so that is really to be expected . The final battle over Endor is very well made both in terms of the general effects and tension wise . It was also a nice touch that Lucas decided to have three battles take place at the same time as it added to the overall tension of the climax . The only thing I feel is dragging the movie down from an otherwise deserved 9 are the Ewoks . These little creatures are so annoying they almost ruin every scene they are in . Besides I find it to be a little to kiddy when a group of teddy bears with bows and arrows can defeat a squadron of Storm Troopers with laser guns and mighty machinery . All in all Return of the Jedi is a very good movie but the fact that Richard Marquand is a less accomplished director than Irvin Kershner does that the overall feel of the movie is less than brilliant . Also George Lucas ' stupid decision to add the Ewoks to the universe does that the film falls short of brilliance . 8/10
This is the one movie to see if you are to wed or are a married couple . The movie portrais a couple in Italy and deals with such difficult topics as abortion , infidelity , juggling work and family . The so called `` culture of death '' that we are experiencing nowadays in the world is terrible and this movie will surely make you think . A must see . I hope it gets distributed as it should . Congratulations on the cast and director . Two thumbs up and a 10 star evaluation from me !
I really dislike both Shrek films . ( Since their both `` PG '' and have words in them I would never say myself , so I disliked them . ) But when it comes to `` Spirit : Stallion of the Cimarron , '' which I just barely watched for the first time last month , I became a fan of animated films , other than Pixar . ***Spoilers ahead*** In `` Spirit : Stallion of the Cimarron , '' a horse foal is born and eventually becomes the leader of his heard . One night , he sees a strange light in the distance , and he sets off toward it . This action eventually leads to his capture , and several more things . Throughout the movie , we hear a narration . It 's through the thoughts of Spirit , though the horses never talk . This is what makes the movie so goo . They ( the movie makers ) recored real horses to do the sounds the horses made ; none of those sounds were made by humans . Spirit meets Rain , a beautiful mare , and Little Creek , a native-American , who owns Rain . Little Creek later frees Spirit and Rain , they go running home . I have never been a big fan of Brian Adams , but I intend to buy the soundtrack to this film in the near future . Watch this film , and you wo n't regret it . My Score : 10/10
You 'd think you 're in for some serious sightseeing when the premise of the movie takes place primarily between two characters as they travel 3000 miles or so from France to Saudi Arabia , going through most of Europe - Italy , Bulgaria , Croatia , Slovenia , Turkey , before arriving in the Middle East . But this is not a tour , and there are no stopovers for soaking in the sights . Reda 's father is in his twilight years , and wishes to do the Haj . However , since walking and taking the mule is out of the question , he chooses to travel to Mecca by car . He ca n't drive , and therefore enlists the help of Reda , to his son 's protest , to get him there in their broken down vehicle . But Reda does n't see the point of having him go along , when his dad could opt for the plane . He resents the idea of having put his personal life on hold for this pilgrimage he could n't understand . And hence , we set off in this arduous journey with father and son , being not the best of pals . The beauty of this movie is to witness the development of the father and son pair , the challenges they face , the weird people they meet , having to duke it out in varied weather conditions , and alternating rest stops between motels and sleeping in the car . We see an obvious generation gap in them trying to communicate to each other , the father trying to impose on his son , and the son trying to assert himself as an adult , but circumstances we see , reveal that Reda is quite a fish out of water . Through the many encounters , they actually team up quite well despite their differences . It 's perhaps quite apt to have this film released here last week to coincide with Hari Raya Haji , and having the opportunity to watch our protagonists join the other pilgrims in their Haj . The final scene in Mecca is truly a sight to behold , and you too would feel the claustrophobia and fear as Reda tries to hunt down his dad amongst the thousands of people congregating . The sights of Europe were perhaps deliberately not dwelled upon , so as to build up the anticipation of and focus on the final destination . It certainly rang home the thought of telling and showing loved ones how much you appreciate them for who they are . Do n't miss this , and yes , book early - I was pleasantly surprised that this evening 's session was still a full house .
I was never a big fan of television until I watched 24 for the first time . I got into the series very late . Season 5 ended before I even saw my very first episode . It was an episode of Series 3 that was on my parents DVR ( digital video recorder ) box while I was house sitting for the weekend . It took that one episode for me to be hook line and sinker into the world of Jack Bauer . And boy was I hooked ! ! I watched the next six episodes without blinking an eye . The next day I went to Blockbuster and signed up for an unlimited month pass for twenty something dollars and needless to say it has been the greatest blockbuster money I 've ever spent . I watched the first three seasons in three weeks . That 's 72 forty minute episodes ! ! ! I will say that finding out what happens next is easier on DVD than waiting an entire week . I can only imagine the anticipation of watching Season 6 week to week ! ! I find it mildly torturous and cruel but I 'm going to give it a try and watch it just like the rest of America ! ! The DVR is set and you can bet I 'll be chomping at the bit ! !
Went to see this as Me and my Lady had little else to do on a sunday afternoon I like films that deal with sleazy , loser characters and this is full of em . After a slow start we get some good turns from the cast but it is the actual 'Bellini ' that both makes and lets the film down . The 'Bellini ' is one of the funniest scenes I have seen in a film for a long while but is too short and could have made this a masterpiece overall 71/2 out of 10
After the failure of `` The Crusades '' at the box office , Cecil B. DeMille stopped doing films about non-American history . His films for the next thirteen years were about our history from Jean Lafitte to World War II ( Dr. Wassell ) . The first in order of production was this film , starring Gary Cooper as Wild Bill Hickok , with Jean Arthur as Calamity Jane . James Ellison was Buffalo Bill , John Miljan ( not a villain as usual ) was General George A. Custer , and Anthony Quinn was one of the Indians who fought at Little Big Horn . The villains were led by Charles Bickford ( selling arms to the Indians ) and Porter Hall as Jack McCall ( who killed Wild Bill Hickok ) . Basically the film takes up the history of the U.S. after the Civil War . Lincoln is shown at the start talking about what is the next step now that Lee has surrendered . Lincoln talks about the need to secure the west ( more about this point later ) . Then he announces he has to go to the theater . That April 14th must have been very busy for Abe - in `` Virginia City '' he grants a pardon to Errol Flynn at the request of Miriam Hopkins on the same date . Actually , while Lincoln was concerned about the West , his immediate thoughts on the last day of his Presidency were about reunifying the former Confederate states and it 's citizens into the Union as soon as possible . It was Reconstruction that occupied his attention , not the west ( except for the problems of Maximillian and his French controlled forces in Mexico against Juarez ) . But he had been involved in actual problems with the West . In 1862 he sent disgraced General John Pope , the loser at Second Manassas , to Minnesota to put down a serious Indian war by the Sioux ( the subject of McKinley Kantor 's novel , `` Sprit Lake '' . Pope , incompetent against Lee and Jackson , turned out to be quite effective here , and the revolt was smashed . However , with all Lincoln 's actual attention to western problems , it is doubtful that he says ( as Cooper repeats at least once ) , `` The frontier should be secure . '' There is nothing to say he could not have said it , but it is hardly a profound pronouncement by a leading statesman . Like saying , Teddy Roosevelt said , `` Eat a good breakfast every morning for your health . '' It is not a profound statement of policy . It is , at best , a statement of recognizable fact . Cooper turning it into a minor mantra , like Lincoln 's version of the Monroe Doctrine , is ridiculous ... typical of the way DeMille 's scripts have really bad errors of common sense in them . However , this is not a ruinous mistake . `` The Plainsman '' is an adventure film , and as such it has the full benefit of DeMille the film creator of spectacle . As such it is well worth watching . But not as a textbook on Lincoln 's political ideas or his quotable legacy .
I heard a few friends one day saying that `` Scarface sucks ... some idiot tried to make another Godfather set in the early 80s . '' Now , I usualy listen to idiots/watch CNN so I decided I 'd stay away from it . Then my mate handed me the DVD and said `` This is # 1 with the pelicangs '' , confused I tried it . This IS THE BEST FILM EVER MADE . It 's more realistic than all this crap about racing stolen cars that are too expensive for someone in that area could afford ( *cough2Fast2Furiouscough* ) There is some humor though ... i.e . the Pelicangs and the light 80s music . Still , whats better than Al Pacino wielding an m203 ? I give this a ***** out of **** , perfect for fans of Al or GTA : Vice City .
'Deliverance ' is a brilliant condensed epic of a group of thoroughly modern men who embark on a canoe trip to briefly commune with nature , and instead have to fight for their sanity , their lives , and perhaps even their souls . The film has aged well . Despite being made in the early Seventies , it certainly does n't look particularly dated . It still possesses a visceral punch and iconic status as a dramatic post-'Death of the Sixties ' philosophical-and-cultural shock vehicle . There are very few films with similar conceits that can compare favourably to it , although the legendary Sam Peckinpah 's stuff would have to be up there . Yes , there has been considerable debate and discussion about the film 's most confronting scene ( which I wo n't expand upon here ) - and undoubtedly one of the most confronting scenes in the entire history of the cinematic medium - but what surprises about this film is how achingly beautiful it is at times . This seems to be generally overlooked ( yet in retrospect quite understandably so ) . The cinematography that captures the essence of the vanishing , fragile river wilderness is often absolutely stunning , and it counterbalances the film as , in a moment of brief madness , we the viewers - along with the characters themselves - are plunged into unrelenting nightmare . 'Deliverance 's narrative is fittingly lean and sinewy , and it is surprising how quickly events unfold from point of establishment , through to crisis , and aftermath . It all takes place very quickly , which lends a sense of very real urgency to the film . The setting is established effectively through the opening credits . The characters are all well-drawn despite limited time spent on back story . We know just enough about them to know them for the kind of man they are , like them and ultimately fear for them when all goes to hell . The conflict and violence within the movie seems to erupt out of nowhere , with a frightening lack of logic . This is author James Dickey 's theme - that any prevailing romanticism about the nature of Man 's perceived inherent 'goodness ' can only wilt and die when his barely suppressed animal instincts come to the fore . There are no demons or bogeymen here . The predatory hillbillies - as the film 's central villains - are merely crude , terrifyingly amoral cousins of our protagonists . They shock because their evil is petty and tangible . The film has no peripheral characters . All reflect something about the weaknesses and uncertainties of urbanised Homo Sapiens in the latter 20th century , and all are very real and recognisable . Burt Reynolds is wonderful in this movie as the gung-ho and almost fatally over-confident Survivalist , Lewis , and it is a shame to think that he really could n't recapture his brief moment of dramatic glory throughout the rest of his still sputtering up-and-down career ( 'Boogie Nights ' excluded , perhaps ) . Trust me , if your are not a Reynolds fan , you WILL be impressed with his performance here . John Voight is his usual effortlessly accomplished self , and Ned Beatty and Ronny Cox both make significant contributions . This is simply a great quartet of actors . To conclude , I must speculate as to if and when 'Deliverance ' author James Dickey 's 'To the White Sea ' will be made . For those that enjoyed ( ? ) this film , TTWS is a similarly harrowing tale of an American Air Force pilot 's struggle for survival after being shot down over the Japanese mainland during WW2 . It 's more of the typically bleak existentialism and primordial savagery that is Dickey 's trademark , but it has all the makings of a truly spectacular , poetic cinematic experience . There was the suggestion a few years ago that the Coen brothers might be producing it , but that eventually came to nothing . Being an avid Coen-o-phile it disappoints me to think what might have been had they gotten the green light on TTWS , rather than their last couple of relatively undistinguished efforts . Returning to 'Deliverance ' , it 's impossible to imagine a movie of such honest , unnerving brutality being made in these times , and that is pretty shameful . We , the cinema-going public , are all the poorer for this .
`` Pushing Daisies '' for sure is one of the best TV shows of its genre in the last 5 years , agree you with that or not . Bryan Fuller , the creator , has an amazing creative mind . He 's the mind behind other great TV Shows as `` Dead Like Me '' ( 2003 ) , `` Wonderfalls '' ( 2004 ) , and the other one not as great as these ones , but also interesting , `` Heroes '' ( 2006 ) . It 's a mix of the marvelous worlds Brian Fuller created in previous TV shows , mixing once again an amazing fantasy world with real kinds of people disguised into colorful images and exaggerated feelings , something that a fairytale always is . So , being a kind of fairytale , you can not expect more than a unrealistic world and unexpected situations , or also situations a lot expected but not in a way that it would usually be told . A gift always comes with a curse , and what is sweet can also be bitter . That 's so , Ned ( Lee Pace ) , The Piemaker , is a simple guy with an interesting gift other than being an amazing chef : he can give life to the dead with just a touch . This could be a power that everybody would die - or live - for if was n't for another simple and very sad thing : he can also gives the forever dead if he touches it again . The curse of this amazing gift does n't stops there ... everything has a compensation and if he brings anything to life for more than one minute , another specie of that one would die instantly . He 's a guy full of unfortunate events in life in a way that he grown up introspectively , always afraid to touch everything and lose once more things he one day used to love . Till the day he could finally be close to his biggest childhood love , Chuck ( Anna Friel ) , if was n't for another sad fact : she was dead . He gave her life again and she loves him so much as he does , but this love is untouchable . The truly kiss of death . And that 's how this beautiful modern fairytale starts . When I heard about `` Pushing Daisies '' for the first time it was promoted as something very familiar ( or maybe some kind of tribute ) to everything that Tim Burton has created since `` Pee-Wee 's Big Adventure '' ( 1985 ) to `` Big Fish '' ( 2003 ) and `` Charlie And The Cholate Factory '' ( 2005 ) . The results could not be better . The world around The Pie Hole was magnificent . The stories around Ned and Detective Cod ( Chi McBride ) to solve unsolved crimes can be a lot common in TV , but this is just a way to guide people thru amazing stories surrounding characters as Chuck and Olive ( Kristin Chenoweth ) in a wonderful world full of beautiful and dreamy images that you can almost sense the taste of the colors . Not only that , you are merged into a bunch of amazing and charismatic gentle characters , even those ones with the most deep dark humors . Forgetting the trivial concept of murders and unsolved crimes , the show brights and is triumphant in a lot of other things . The actors here are top of note . Lee Pace is tender , soft and contained as the character asks for . Anna Friel is the muse of the show as her character is supposed to be . But the most superb times are always with the supporting actors as Chi McBride ( Detective Emmerson Cod ) , Swoozie Kurtz ( as Lilly Charles ) , Ellen Greene ( as Vivian Charles ) and Kristin Chenoweth ( as Olive Snook ) . Swoozie Kurtz shines performing a so dried character drowned in a impossible dark humor that could frighten a clown , for sure she has the best dialogs and her expressions and body languages are mesmerizing . But if the best dialogs are given by Swoozie and her character , the best funny moments are given by Kristin Chenoweth . Seems that she 's improvising all the time , she 's so naturally fun that every single scene is a show aside . Kristin shines so bright in the show that winning the 2009 Emmy for her supporting role in the show was totally fair and deserved . Also there 's the chemistry between actors and their characters , that are also amazing . There are no words to express what this TV Show really is and what it was meant to be . For those ones who think this show is a waste of time or claimed to find no sense in it , for sure needs to open their minds and comeback to a time that they probably never had : childhood . Truth be told ... TV has never been so daring in a TV Show as with this amazing one . `` Pushing Daisies '' was a huge step forward in terms of great artistic entertainment and its sudden death was a lot disrespectful . It 's true that TV does n't respect great TV shows as those ones Bryan Fuller created - except `` Heroes '' that 's still on air and is far from being so amazing as the other ones .
I 've read some terrible things about this film , so I was prepared for the worst . `` Confusing . Muddled . Horribly structured . '' While there may be merit to some of these accusations , this film was nowhere near as horrific as your average DVD programmer . In fact , it actually had aspirations . It attempted something beyond the typical monster/slasher nonsense . And by god , there are some interesting things going on . Ms. Barbeau is a miracle to behold . She carries the film squarely on her shoulders . This is not to say that it 's a masterpiece . UNHOLY ultimately collapses under the weight of its own ambition . There are just too many ( unexplained ) subplots trying to coexist . And the plot loopholes created by time travel are never really addressed : for example , if Hope knows that her mother is evil and that she will ultimately kill her brother , then why does n't she just kill Ma in the film 's very first sequence ? Seems like it would have beat the hell out of traveling into the future to do it . Still , I give UNHOLY points for trying . A little ambition is not a bad thing .
I have n't seen much German comedy , but if this film is anything to go by , I 'm compelled to see more ! The simple but effective storyline takes two very different people on a trip from Germany to Italy after Eva , an unemployed mother of two , discovers that her artist husband is having an affair with the wife of a wealthy lawyer . I wo n't reveal anything further , but what results is a very funny series of events with the perfect conclusion . My interest in international cinema has expanded since I first saw this film . I recommend it to anyone ( any adult ... do n't let the inclusion of the young children fool you into thinking it 's a family film ) who love comedy - even those unfamiliar with the language .
Henry Hathaway was daring , as well as enthusiastic , for his love of the people of the early days in US history . However , to critique historical inaccuracies of his film about Brigham Young and the Mormon people are not necessary or useful in commenting for this film . In my opinion , Hathaway did superb direction that conveys what a Mormon people were in the early history of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-Day Saints during the time period beginning with the martyrdom of Joseph Smith to the date of film release . In often subtle filming and dialog delivery , he covered Mormon philosophies and teachings in many of the segments and scenes . I remember watching this movie on many Saturday mornings during my youth in the early 1950 's . That was just over 10 years after the films release and before the Los Angeles Temple was completed , which I watched being constructed and instilled more curious wonder of who Mormons were . I recently purchased this film and will enjoy the following messages that Hathaway interpreted in his film . 1 . Love for all people , regardless of their personal beliefs , 2 . Charity to those in need or not , 3 . Family is high in importance , 4 . Listen respectfully and carefully , because even opposing messages have important points to consider and adopt , 5 . Work hard , both individually and in community , 6 . Prepare and store for future days of need , 7 . Hope is a binding link to a higher being , and for our daily lives , 8 . And , that there is a unique quality to any group , and appreciate those that are identified as beneficial .
Good sequel to Murder in a Small Town . In this one Cash and his police Lt. buddy unravel a sticky plot involving a Nazi criminal , a philanthropic witch , and a family of screw-ups and their wierdo helpers . As in the original , the viewer is treated to a nice little mystery with distinctive sights and sounds of pre-war America . Go see it .
Jodie Foster , Cherie Currie ( the former lead singer of the seminal all-girl rock group the Runaways in her remarkably able acting debut ) , Marilyn Kagan , and Kandice Stroh are uniformly believable , splendid and touching as the titular quartet , who are a tight-knit clique of troubled , fiercely loyal adolescent girls with negligent , uncaring , self-absorbed parents who do their best to grow up and fend for themselves in the affluent San Fernando Valley , California suburbs . The girls are forced to make serious decisions about sex , drugs , alcohol , commitment , and so on at a tender young age when they 're not fully prepared to completely own up to the potentially harmful consequences of said decisions . Foster , giving one of her most perceptive , affecting and underrated performances to date , is basically the group 's den mother who presides over the well-being of both herself and the others ; she 's especially concerned about the good-hearted , but reckless and self-destructive Currie , whose carelessly hedonistic lifestyle makes her likely to meet an untimely end . This picture offers a poignant , insightful , often devastatingly credible and thoroughly absorbing examination of broken , dysfunctional families which exist directly underneath suburbia 's neatly manicured surface and the tragic net result of such families : tough , resilient , but unhappy and vulnerable kids who have to confront the trials and tribulations of growing up on their own because their parents are either too inconsiderate or even nonexistent . Adrian ( `` Fatal Attraction , '' `` Jacob 's Ladder '' ) Lyne 's direction is both sturdy and observant while Gerald Ayres ' script is somewhat messy and rambling , but overall still accurate in its frank , gritty , unsentimental depiction of your average latchkey kid 's nerve-wrackingly chaotic , capricious and unpredictable everyday life . Leon Bijou 's soft , dewy , almost pastoral cinematography properly suggests a delicate and easily breakable sense of tranquility and innocence . Giorgio Moroder arranged the excellent score , which makes particularly effective use of Donna Summer 's elegiac `` On the Radio . '' The top-notch cast includes Sally Kellerman as Foster 's neurotic , insecure , peevish mother , Scott Baio as a sweet skateboarder dude , Randy Quaid as Kagan 's rich older boyfriend , British 60 's pop singer Adam Faith as Foster 's feckless , absentee rock promoter father , and Lois Smith as Kagan 's smothering , overprotective mother . Appearing in brief bits are Robert Romanus ( Mike Damone `` Fast Times at Richmont High '' ) as one of Foster 's morose ex-boyfriends and a gawky , braces-wearing Laura Dern as an obnoxious party crasher . Achingly authentic , engrossing and deeply moving ( Currie 's grim ultimate fate is very heart-breaking ) , `` Foxes '' is quite simply one of the most unsung and under-appreciated teen movies made about early 80 's adolescence .
Ever since seeing this film as a child , over 30 years ago , I never tire of watching it . From the opening scenes in the horn factory , to the car motor running from the back seat of the car , to Ollie answering the phone and being accidentally pushed out the window by Stan , I think this was perhaps their best latter day film . After this they moved to 20th Century Fox , and while those films were n't terrible , they lacked the comic timing of this movie . Jimmy Finnlayson , their long time foil , in his last appearance with the boys , showing up as the Doctor is super ! quote : `` I said goat milk `` his reply to Stan asking him how do you milk a ghost ! Charlie Hall and even Ben Turpin show up ! I 'd say all in all one of my favorite L & H comedies .
When one thinks of 1950s science fiction films one thinks of the sort of schlocky black and white B films that were parodied on the old Mystery Science Theater 3000 television show . Yet , while there were far more films like Plan 9 From Outer Space and Robot Monster than good films , the 1950s did have some very good , if not great , science fiction films like The Day The Earth Stood Still , The Incredible Shrinking Man , Invasion Of The Body Snatchers , War Of The Worlds , and The Thing From Another World . Yet , the best of the bunch , for its literacy and production values , was undoubtedly MGM 's first big foray into A level science fiction , Forbidden Planet , released in 1956 . It was a 98 minute color film , directed by Fred M. Wilcox , that featured then state of the art special effects , and was endowed with a very good screenplay by Cyril Hume , from a screen treatment called Fatal Planet , by Irving Block and Allen Adler , who adapted aspects of William Shakespeare 's The Tempest into it . The film drew raves when it was released , for its Oscar nominated special effects , its all electronic music score , by Louis and Bebe Barron ( although credited as Electronic Tonalities , to avoid music guild fees ) , vivid matte paintings- inspired by Chesley Bonestell , and the famed Monster Of The Id ( MOTI ) , which was animated by an animator , Joshua Meador , on loan from the Walt Disney studio . Even more famous was the appearance of Robby The Robot , in his first role in either film or television . Later he would appear in the film The Invisible Boy- included in this DVD as a bonus , as well as several appearances in the 1960s sci fi TV shows The Twilight Zone , Night Gallery , and Lost In Space- with whose own robot he is often confused , and a cameo appearance in the 1984 film Gremlins . The tale is simple , but elegantly constructed , and filled with humorous asides that leaven the forced 'love story ' aspect in the film . In the 23rd Century , the United Planets Cruiser C-57D- a flying saucer , led by Commander J.J. Adams ( Leslie Nielsen- yes he was once a leading man type before his Police Squad days ) , is en route to the planet Altair IV , to investigate what happened to the crew of the Bellerophon , sent to the planet twenty years earlier . After a year 's journey , there they encounter the lone survivor of the party , Doctor Edward Morbius ( Walter Pidgeon ) , the Prospero stand-in- a philologist , his gorgeous blond daughter Altaira ( Anne Francis ) - the Miranda character in a pre 1960s miniskirt , and Robby the Robot , the domestic servant who is the Calibanian counterpart . Morbius warns the crew of a mysterious force that killed the Bellerophon party in their first year , yet he was immune to it . All in all , it 's a technically good film- especially with some rear projections and matte paintings , and the absurdity of the adult reactions to Timmy 's and Robby 's exploits borders an Dalian surreal absurdity . Yet , it 's manifest that the filmmakers had no sense of the sublime absurdity the film conjures , for it 's played straight , thus making it even funnier . As for the main feature ? Forbidden Planet deserves all its kudos . It 's not a perfect film , but it 's a great way to spend a couple of hours , and far better than Star Wars , which although made twenty years later seems much more outdated , and juvenile . Only such films like 2001 : A Space Odyssey , Solaris , Alien and Aliens , and the first two Terminator films , have really equaled or surpassed this classic in depth and effects . It 's worth knowing that , despite Forbidden Planet 's 'happy ending ' , there is the possibility that the MOTI is still dormant within Alta , as well . After all , she is her father 's daughter , and had an even more vivid nightmare than her father when the MOTI attacked the ship a second time . Also , the film wisely only 'shows ' the MOTI once , and never shows the Krel , for the imagination can always conjure greater scares than the best special effects . The film also makes good use of narrative ellipses to condense the tale , something that far more realistic art films often fail to do . Forbidden Planet is one of those rare films that both defines yet transcends its era- unlike other sci fi films which were rather obvious Cold War allegories . Watch it , and you will agree , as well as sleep a little less easy . But , even if you do n't , there 's still the scene of Anne Francis skinnydipping . That alone is timeless .
I was on France , around March 05 , and I love to go to this Film Festivals . I knew about this Cinémas d'Amérique Latine de Toulouse , but I 've never went to it . I decided to go and then I caught Cero y van 4 . The film is stunning . It does n't caused the impact on me like with the Mexican users , because it was french-subtitled but it 's still shocking . This film is a satire about urban violence , about kidnapping and crime on the streets in Mexico . It is a crude portrait of the city . Of a Metropolis . Secuestro Express , with a stunning Mia Maestro , which was also a satire of kidnapping , almost , but with a more serious tone has , and I think so , some kinda connection with Cero y van 4 . A , sort of , redemption story and that how much is too much ? Man on Fire , that was stunningly strong , was also , not a satire , but a crude portrait into the streets of Mexico . Or it is like The Brave One . A film that shocks and hits you in the guts very hard . This is like The Usual Suspects , it has some plot twists and turns , but that makes it even more believable . Verdict : A film that shocks and makes you believe that there 's no security on the streets anymore . Stunning dialogue , impressive direction and astonishing performances . Cero y van 4 is a film that you wo n't forget soon . Leaves you shaking and stunned .
This is one of my favorite films of all time . I read the book and liked it , but this movie expands on everything the book made famous . The acting is fantastic , especially from Jon Voight , who plays Mr. Sir , a very evil character . This film has a certain way of storytelling that keeps you hooked throughout , until the end where everything is pulled together for a great ending . I also love the way this is directed , by flashing back and forth between the modern day and Stanley 's ancestors ' stories . The story was written by Louis Sachar , yes , but it seems that this story is made for film , and Andrew Davis does a great job directing it . I definitely recommend this to anyone who enjoys good movies .
World At War is perhaps the greatest documentary series of all time . The historical research is virtually flawless . Even after a quarter century , it is the most accurate and definitive documentary about WW2 . An invaluable historical work that includes interviews with some of the most important and fascinating figures from the war . I highly recommend it as a learning experience .
If you want to be cynical and pedantic you could point out that the opening where a RAF Lancaster bomber is mortally wounded on the 2nd of May 1945 is somewhat unlikely since German air defences were as lively as Adolph Hitler on that day but this is n't a movie that should be viewed by a cynical audience and I guess a character being killed in literally the last hours of the war adds to the poignancy . In fact you 'd have to have survived the second world war to fully appreciate the intellect , beauty and soul of Powell and Pressburger 's masterpiece . The scenes of heaven are painfully twee when viewed today ? Again you have to view the movie of the context when it was made . RAF bomber command lost 58,000 men during the war , the same number that America lost in 'Nam but during a shorter period and a far , far smaller pool of active combatants , there 's no atheists in a fox hole and I doubt if you 'd lost a relative during the conflict you 'd view material atheism as being a sensible thing . When Richar Attenborough 's young pilot looks down in awe at the sight below him many war heroes must have openly wept at this scene as they remembered much missed comrades who did n't survive the war . Also bare in mind that despite losing several million people from 1939-45 there seems to be very few people from Germany passing through the pearly gates . it 's obvious Nazis do n't go to heaven The plot itself where dashing young pilot Peter Carter arguing for his life in front of a celestial court would n't have had much appeal to me if it was n't for the subtext , you see A MATTER OR LIFE AND DEATH is a highly political and visionary film that laments the end of the British empire as it 's replaced by American ambitions . There 's little things that show up the film as being made by people aware of American history and culture . One is the ethnic mix of America , even today many Britons think that the USA is overwhelmingly composed of White Anglo Saxon Protestants when in fact only 51 % of Americans are `` White European `` . The film rightly contains a scene where a multitude of different races confess `` I am an American `` as Peter is judged by Abraham Farlan , an Anglophobe who was the first revolutionary killed by British forces in The American War Of Independence . As for the `` special relationship `` between Britain and America - What special relationship ? Powell and Pressburger know their history when it comes to Britain and America . They obviously know their future too So remember to watch this movie with some of your mind in the past and some of your mind in the present . It 's strange , beautiful , poignant and clever but most of all it 's a film that would never ever work if it were made in the last 40 years . Can you imagine if the story was set in 2003 and revolved around a British soldier killed in Iraq ?
This film is , in short , a cinematic masterpiece . The film is moved along brilliantly by intense images that deeply move the sensitive viewer . The film opens during the Spanish Civil War as a group of children seek their revenge on another child . In fact , they are acting out in their world a version of what they have witnessed in the adult world around them . Later we meet three of these children again as adults at a sanatorium . Here we see what life has wrought on each of them . One is a reclusive sexually repressed patient . Another man is a hustler who has become ill . The third child , a young lady , has become a nun and is serving at the sanatorium . This film is an allegory about the effect of violence on the psyche . This film has a climax that is definitely not for the squeamish members of the viewing audience but it is logical as well as profoundly moving . The acting is excellent and the script is quite well written . There is a musical score that provides an undercurrent of dread throughout this film . This is not a film for thrill seekers but a film for a thoughtful audience .
Russell , my fav , is gorgeous in this film . But more than that , the film covers a tremendous range of human passion and sorrow . Everything from marriage to homosexuality is addressed and respected . The film makes the viewer realize that tolerance of other humans provides the route to saving humanity . Fabulous love story between Lachlin and Lil . I replay their scenes over and over again . Anyone who has ever been in love will empathize with these people . All characters are cast and portrayed excellently .
*Wonderland SPOILERS* July 1st , 1981 : five people , Ron Launius ( Josh Lucas ) , Susan Launius ( Christina Applegate ) , Billy Deverell ( Tim Blake Nelson ) , Barbara Richardson ( Natasha Gregson Wagner ) and Joy Miller ( Janeane Garofalo ) are attacked while they 're asleep and brutally hit on the head with steel pipes in their home at 8763 Wonderland Avenue , Laurel Canyon , LA . Only Susan survives . Main Suspect : John Holmes ( Val Kilmer ) , former king of porn , owner of a 30 cm long dick , and now a hopeless addict . Two investigators , Luis ( Frankie G. ) and Sam Nico ( Ted Levine ) , are investigating on the case and try to crack it with the help of a witness that claims to know that John at the very least took part in the murders , David Lind ( Dylan McDermott ) , Barbara 's boyfriend , and trying to get a witness report out of Dawn Schiller ( Kate Bosworth ) , Holmes ' 19-year-old girlfriend and from Susan , who sadly does n't remember anything more than shadows about the night her husband 's head was bashed in and hers almost suffered the same fate , and the name of Eddie Nash ( Eric Bogosian ) , a major drug kingpin ( who is always around ladies such as Barbie ( Paris Hilton ) ) , comes into light as a suspect planner of the Wonderland massacre . But what did happen that night ? And could Sharon ( Lisa Kudrow ) , John 's wife , know something about it ? 'Wonderland ' is a taught , intense thriller , a desperate love story and a story of a man 's sad decline all in one ; there is a clever use of the 'Rashomon ' technique ( we see the events of that fateful day and night from the eyes of David , John , Dawn , Susan ( albeit very briefly ) and Sharon ) , a nice direction and a great script , but is mostly compelling for the performances , especially Kilmer 's , who takes central stage with his hopeless , tormented , sometimes childish Holmes , Lucas ' , whose Launius is strangely alluring , Kudrow 's strong Sharon and Bosworth 's innocent Dawn . Wonderland : 9/10 .
I 'm overwhelmed by the work of Jim Carrey . I keep on getting this movie stuck in my head . The Grinch liking Martha May , Cindy Lou ( who 's very annoying ; her sweet innocence ) who tries to get the Grinch in the Christmas spirit , the childhood of the Grinch ( very funny ! ) , and moreover the weak obvious ending with- Christmas is n't all about presents . I have to say , I felt stupid walking out of the theater with a bunch of babies and toddlers laughing and so forth , but this movie was a good full-lengthed adaption of Dr.Seuss 's short film and IS for all ages .
Raggedy Ann and Raggedy Andy THE MOVIE is about dolls that come to life when the humans are n't around . In this adventure they must rescue a kidnapped french doll named Babette from the captain of pirates . On their way they journey though Deep Dark Woods , Taffy Pit , and even Looney Land . Will the aide of their new friend The Camel With Wrinkled Knees help them or just slow them down with his hallucinations of his friends leaving him ? How will they escape the Kookoo king and his henchmen ! ? What will their owner Marcella say when she sees her 7th birthday present doll gone along with her other toys ? Delightful surprises await the two adventurers . All scores are out of a possible 10 : Story : 8 - Very cute . Dolls that come to life when the master is n't around . Not just that because they go out into many many different places , but they are in an imaginary world so anything can happen . Meeting new characters , going to different places finding new friends , its great . The characters all work so well in this too and who does n't love pirates ? ! Acting : 8 - Every character suits their voice so well . Specifically the Marlon Brando taffy pit enemy , The Greed . The french doll has a very uptight french accent , the evil Hitler-esquire king Kookoo ( whos got hair that resembles Simpson 's Sideshow Bob ) plays his role very well , and the sorrow old black man voice for Camel works perfectly . Why is it that old dubbed animation was soo much better than new ones ? Music : 10 - Nothing short of perfection here . The songs have been in my head for years , and re-watching it nearly 20 years later , i can still remember each and every one of them and will now be able to know exactly where these tunes come from . Joe Raposo of `` Sesame Street '' fame did an excellent job with the songs for this and everyone sings real well . Editing : 6 - Heh , this is where it 'll get confusing . I mean how far did the Raggedy 's walk anyway ? A lot of events just seem to occur one after another and there 's no telling WHO the other dolls and toys were as you never see them in the real world of the movie , but it does follow some sort of path and you know they 'll eventually get to where they need to go , its just pretty hard to follow at times . Uniqueness : 8 - Between this and Unico i 'd have to say there 's parts in both movies i will never forget no matter how hard i try to . Mainly the scary parts . I 've probably mentioned already how older movies were Much creepier than animation of today but this takes the cake in the scary factor . Outside of the South Park movie and some Disney films there 's almost no animated musicals , or good ones of that coming out so its very unique . Worth : 8- Its classic . Worth the hunt to get a good copy thats for sure , but the VHS copies are probably all stretched out by now . The DVD version is sold on Ebay all the time and it 'll definitely be something you 'll watch more than once . If anything get it for the nostalgia purposes . Overall Score ( Not an average ) : 8 - Its a wonderful timeless musical made in the late 70s and can still be enjoyed today . Its characters are all unique and the songs are great . So great you might find yourself humming them time and time again . Give your favorite stuffed animal a hug today ! Reviewer 's Insight ( Including bias ) : This is n't like the Raggedy Ann TV series made a decade later . This was way more darker and real world . The effects in this seem like a lot of other acid-trip cartoons from the 70 's , in particular , Yellow Submarine . Still , its given me memories I 'll never forget , and might still influence things today . It was n't easy to find but it 'll remain a treasure to keep in my collection of DVDs and videos forever .
A well-made run-of-the-mill movie with a tragic ending . Pluses : The way the story moves - begins with Soorya struggling to live followed by a long flashback about why he 's there . The Music . A disinterested look at the life of policemen . Minuses : The violence and the gore , but I guess they add to the realistic effects . Still , having people 's heads chopped off and sent in boxes and sacks could have been avoided . No complaints - 7/10
While originally reluctant to jump on the bandwagon of watching `` Lost '' , I accidentally caught one episode at the beginning of season 1the one with the polar-bearand it has had my undivided attention ever since . The show , that is . Not the polar bear . So bear ( heh ) with me while I throw out as much rambling , semi-coherent praise as I can muster . `` Lost '' takes a simple idea of a passenger flight full of people crashing onto a desert island , and gradually adds extraordinary depth to its premise by exploring each character deeply and unflinchinglywhat drives them , who are they ? Where did they come from ? It soon becomes clear that the island upon which they are stranded acts as a common denominator for many things in their lives , whether they 're running away from something ( Sawyer and Kate among others ) or getting in touch with spirituality ( Locke , Claire ) . But `` Lost '' also zooms in on the island itself and the mysterious horrors that it houses ... and they all seem to be strangely connected . While television actors are not exactly known for their subtlety or dazzling acting abilities , most of the cast of `` Lost '' are , in truth , spectacular actors for their respective parts , projecting heart and humour in their performances . There 's also a multitude of eyecandy , but not generally of the plastic Hollywood kind as most TV shows . The characters all feel very real and they are extremely compelling to watch . Their interactions rarely fall prey to predictable sappiness , petty arguments or cheesy melodrama ( although they are annoyingly secretive )  these people are first and foremost trying to survive and whatever relationship appears is treated secondary to action . The realism of these characters facilitate an already well-sculptured plot . About this plot ... Imagine a tree as the template plot , then the branches as subplots ( in this case , one branch for every character )  well , Lost adds twigs to each branch and then tiny twigs to those twigs as other story lines . If you 're a brother/sister to one of the main characters in the flashbacks , you will get your own storyline . If you 're a DOG you will have your own storyline . Unless the writers manage to weave them all together into some glorious culmination in the end , they are setting themselves up . I am more than a little worried there will be some disappointing cop-out to this show , as I 'm sure most people are . But assuming the writers do pull this off , `` Lost '' is possibly the best show ever to hit television . 9/10
A kid with ideals who tries to change things around him . A boy who is forced to become a man , because of the system . A system who hides the truth , and who is violating the rights of existence . A boy who , inspired by Martin Luther King , stands up , and tells the truth . A family who is falling apart , and fighting against it . A movie you ca n't hide from . You see things , and you hear things , and you feel things , that you till the day you die will hope have never happened for real . Violence , frustration , abuse of power , parents who ca n't do anything , and a boy with , I am sorry , balls , a boy who will not accept things , who will not let anything happen to him , a kid with power , and a kid who acts like a pro , like he has never done anything else , he caries this movie to the end , and anyone who wants to see how abuse found place back in the 60'ies .
Let 's keep it simple : My two kids were glued to this movie . It has its flaws from an adult perspective , but buy some jelly-worms and just enjoy it . And the Pepsi girl was excellent ! And Kimberly Williams was pretty gosh-darned hot , although she 's not in the film very much , so do n't get too excited there . Not that 's it 's really a bad thing , but it is the kind of movie you watch just once . Do n't buy the DVD . Enjoy ! Did I mention Kimberly Williams ? ( That was for the dads . )
Chilling , majestic piece of cinematic fright , this film combines all the great elements of an intellectual thriller , with the grand vision of a director who has the instinctual capacity to pace a moody horror flick within the realm of his filmmaking genius that includes an eye for the original shot , an ice-cold soundtrack and an overall sense of dehumanization . This movie cuts through all the typical horror movies like a red-poker through a human eye , as it allows the viewer to not only feel the violence and psychosis of its protagonist , but appreciate the seed from which the derangement stems . One of the scariest things for people to face is the unknown and this film presents its plotting with just that thought in mind . The setting is perfect , in a desolate winter hideaway . The quietness of the moment is a character in itself , as the fermenting aggressor in Jack Torrance 's mind wallows in this idle time , and breeds the devil 's new playground . I always felt like the presence of evil was dormant in all of our minds , with only the circumstances of the moment , and the reasons given therein , needed to wake its violent ass and pounce over its unsuspecting victims . This film is a perfect example of this very thought . And it is within this film 's subtle touches of the canvas , the clackity-clacks of the young boy 's big wheel riding along the empty hallways of the hotel , the labyrinthian garden representing the mind 's fine line between sane and insane , Kubrick 's purposely transfixed editing inconsistencies , continuity errors and set mis-arrangements , that we discover a world guided by the righteous and tangible , but coaxed away by the powerful and unknown . I have never read the book upon which the film is based , but without that as a comparison point , I am proud to say that this is one of the most terrifying films that I have ever seen . I thought that the runtime of the film could 've been cut by a little bit , but then again , I am not one of the most acclaimed directors in the history of film , so maybe I should keep my two-cent criticisms over a superb film , to myself . All in all , this movie captures your attention with its grand form and vision , ropes you in with some terror and eccentric direction , and ties you down and stabs you in the heart with its cold-eyed view of the man 's mind gone overboard , creepy atmosphere and the loss of humanity . Rating : 9/10
Stupid , Stupid , Stupid . I think that Angelina Jolie is probably one of the most talented actress ' today , but a movie like this is n't just worth her time . She deserves better , and so does everyone else in this movie . Talent is just wasted . Sorry , but i do n't feel like writing a review for this . I give it NO stars out of ***** .
Why ca n't more directors these days create horror movies like `` The Shining '' ? There 's an easy answer to that : modern day directors are not Stanley Kubrick . Kubrick proved once-and-for-all with this movie that he is truly one of the greatest directors and auteurs of all time . So , the plot is fairly simple . A man named Jack Torrance ( played brilliantly by Jack Nicholson ) and his family move into a large , secluded hotel to watch over it for the off-season . The kicker is that the previous caretaker of the hotel savagely murdered his wife and two girls . What follows can most readily be summed by the title of the movie , but you have to watch it to see what I mean . This is the first movie in a very long time to strike me as `` scary '' . It 's some seriously messed up stuff , but in a good way . One of the things that adds to the scare factor is the amazing music . Music has been a major part of Kubrick 's movies ( 2001 : A Space Oddysey and A Clockwork Orange , just to name a couple ) and he definitely does n't disappoint with this one . The score completely sets the tone and this film would not be the same without it . Finally , I must comment on Nicholson 's legendary performance . Jack is terrifyingly convincing as a crazy killer . In fact , just his stare steals a few scenes of this movie . This is top-notch acting that must be seen to believe . There will never be a horror movie that quite matches this one . R.I.P . Stanley .
A bit quirky and bordering bad taste ; but intelligent enough to be worthy of watching . A wheelchair-bound young woman Jane Hatchard ( Helena Bonham Carter ) is teamed with a reluctant caregiver , Richard ( Kenneth Branagh ) . Richard is an artist that daydreams of human flight . He builds an airplane in his garage and intends to fly it . He wants to resurrect his own troubled life by taking care of the independent , dying Jane , who suffers from an neurological disease that has all but left her speechless and very little motor skills . Wheelchair-bound and full of spirit , her last dying wish is to loose her virginity . She offers herself to Richard , who wo n't help her directly ; but is willing to rob a bank in order to pay a gigolo to do the deed . I found this flick ambitious and humorous . Even in this role , Carter has a certain charisma and likability .
Once again , I was browsing through the discount video bin and picked up this movie for $ 4.88 . Fifty-percent of the time the movies I find in the bin are pure crap ( I mean horrible beyond belief ) but half the time they turn out to be surprisingly good . This movie is much better than I expected . I found it very engaging , though it was obviously made by an amateur . The direction is nothing special , but the story is intriguing with some good thrills . I expected it to be more of a comedy , but I was n't too disappointed . For a thriller , this movie is surprisingly good-natured . There 's no bloody violence , no profanity , no nudity , no sex . Usually , these movies require all four of those elements . The PG rating is well-deserved -- not like `` Sixteen Candles '' where the `` f '' word is used twice and there 's a brief gratuitous nude scene . I just wish the romance between Corey Haim and his love interest could 've been developed more . The film does tend to be plot-heavy , and the potentially good subplots are pushed off to the side . Instead of developing a chemistry between the two of them , we end up watching a careless three-minute montage of them on their romantic endeavors . They end up kissing at the end , but there 's so little chemistry that it seems forced . `` The Dream Machine '' is no gem , but it 's good , clean entertainment . It 's quite forgettable -- especially with a cast of unknowns , except for Haim -- but it 's also much better than you 'd expect . My score : 7 ( out of 10 )
SPOILERS This is a gripping movie about grifters . But who is conning who here ? When does the hunter turn into the prey ? This gritty , dark movie is slow moving and seductive . It pulls you in and drags you down the proverbial garden path , only to waylay you just as you think you are safe . It has a riveting script , with good acting ( at least from the leads ) . I did n't notice the background music , but it was never jarring , so it must have been done right . I was very surprised that I liked this movie , because I do n't usually go for this genre but this one sucked me in and kept he hooked until the end .
Red Eye is not the kind of movie that 's going to win the Palme D'or , but Wes Craven has never been that kind of director , anyway , and his branding is a good indication of what a film-goer can expect . The fact that Red Eye is a tight little , undemanding package at 94 minutes is part of its charm and an indication of Craven 's craft in producing lightweight , but generally enjoyable , box office fare . In fact , it 's the perfect kind of movie to show as inflight entertainment , attention-holding without putting any intellectual or emotional challenges on the viewer . Overall there is a cheesy feeling to the plot , vague terrorist subplot motivation and the supporting characters , and the main section has a TV movie feel . However , there are definite elements of Hitchcockian suspense , and echoes of Schumacher 's Phone Booth , which ultimately is a more sophisticated ( and pretentious ) play on the same idea of emotional crisis being played out suppressed in public . For a film that focuses mainly on two people sitting in airline seats , it lives or dies on the characters and script . Cillian 's icy but eloquent Jackson Rippner and Rachel MacAdams resourceful Lisa are the main reasons the film gets carried off . Not only making the dialogue zing but also giving some sort of Adam 's Rib type dimension to their battle of 'male logic ' against feminine 'sensitivity ' . In the final portion of the film Craven indulges himself a little Scream style as man-chases-girl-with-knife . The most surprising revelation here is what Brian Cox looks like after the 'Just for Men ' treatment , his ubiqutous appearance in films as diverse as Super Troopers , The Ring and this making him the sexegenarian version of Jude Law . Short haul fun .
Ah , McBain The character name is immortalized and forever ridiculed by `` The Simpsons '' but it will also always  to me personally , at least  remain the name and title of a tremendously entertaining and outrageously violent early 90 's action flick ; directed by the cool dude who brought us `` The Exterminator '' and starring two of the most ultimately badass B-movie heroes Christopher Walken and Michael Ironside ( the latter with a cute little macho ponytail ) . I guess `` McBain '' will largely have to be labeled as a guilty pleasure , because there 's no way I can convince anyone this is an intellectual motion picture . The film is unimaginably preposterous ( most action heroes take on a small gangster posse McBain takes on an entire country ) and yet takes itself way too seriously . The script is a non-stop and incoherent spitfire of clichéd situations , nonsensical twists , compulsory sentimental interludes , grotesquely staged action sequences and utterly implausible character drawings . It 's a totally delirious movie ; I loved it . Vietnam POW McBain 's life is saved by fellow soldier Roberto Santos on the very last day of the war . They each keep half a dollar note as a symbol that McBain is in Santos ' debt . Eighteen years later , Santos is a spirited rebel leading the revolution against the corrupt president of his home country Columbia . Santos initial attempt to take over the power fails and he 's publicly executed on El Presidente 's balcony . His sister travels to New York with the dollar note and turns to McBain for financial assistance and manpower . McBain and his former Vietnam buddies , who all coincidentally happen to be fed up with the injustice in this world , charter themselves a miserable little plane and fly to Columbia to open a gigantic can of whoop-ass . Okay , let 's not fool each other here . The fact you 're reading a user- comment on `` McBain '' already indicates that you have some sort of interest for low-budget B-movie action . One of my fellow reviewers spent quite some time composing a list containing all the main stupidities and insensible moments of `` McBain '' . This list is totally accurate and I can only concur with it . Heck , I could even add some more senseless sequences to that list ( like the preposterous and needless heroic self- sacrifice of a soldier who does n't even have any affinity with the goal of the mission and the rest of McBain 's squad ) , but what 's the point ? You definitely know not to expect a 100 % coherent and plausible masterpiece . We know from beforehand this will be a silly and exaggeratedly flamboyant movie , and it 's maybe even the exact reason why we want to check it out ! This is a terrifically outrageous and exciting movie about a bunch of former Vietnam buddies turning into mercenaries and declaring war against the corrupt Columbian president and the national drug cartel . Please do n't expect another `` Apocalypse Now '' . This particular motion picture relies on the ruff 'n tuff acting performances of the macho leads , a whole lot of explosions and gunfights and  last but not least  a fantastic soundtrack in which Joan Baez sings a cover of `` Brothers in Arms '' .
I have seen the freebird movie and think its great ! its laid back fun , about time the British film industry came through with something entertaining ! ! its good how the guy who met them at the service station gets mentioned way into the film in the news agents , nice touch . The acting was convincing ( i am a biker ) they reminded me of some good times i have had in the bike scene . It was good to see the film director getting in on the acting , well done jon ! At the end a new crop gets mentioned , in Ireland is this the foundation for a 2nd film ? hope so keep them coming . Great film , well written , realistic characters !
I agree with another user here and have to say that this is one of the best Kung Fu movies ever ! I watched this as a kid and absolutely loved it ! The scaffolding scenes are brilliant and you can really empathise with this guy because he is treated as an outcast . Nice humour and fantastic kung fu this movie rocks ! If you like Kung Fu you would love this ! ! !
I have seen several comments here about Brando using a Southern accent , some of which felt it was a mistake . When this movie was made , racism and discrimination were very strong in the South . The Jim Crow laws were still in effect . Civil Rights was in it 's infancy . Could this have possibly been a subtle social commentary , a Southern man in love with a woman of another race ? The same way MASH was a subtle criticism of the Viet Nam war ? Any thoughts ? Another comment was made about Myoshi Umeki appearing `` cold '' . Anyone who has been in Japan would understand . The Japanese people , at least in my experience , did not tend to show emotion in front of strangers . There were strict social rules , especially for men meeting single women . Americans in Japan were totally foreign to this culture , and the blunt attempts to meet women were shocking to the ladies . One trait of the Japanese was to smile when embarrassed or uncomfortable , which many American servicemen took as a sign that their advances were welcomed . Also remember that at the time represented in the movie , Japan had just been defeated , and the occupying forces were treated with reluctant acceptance . I think Myoshi Umeki gave a very credible performance of what her situation would have been . Watching her interaction with the American actors brought back several memories of my own experiences in the country . I was able to meet a pair of lovely young ladies who , after I convinced them I was not the typical American male , taught me their language and their culture during my time in their country .
When the Chamberlain family is camping near Ayers Rock , Australia , Lindy Chamberlain ( Meryl Streep ) sees her baby being dragged out of their tent by a dingo and then begins an ordeal that no one should have to experience . For it seems like the dingo story is not believed by the public or the press , and the whole thing turns into a circus . Lindy does n't help matters either because she wo n't play to the jury or courtroom , she 's only herself , and she 's a tough nut to crack , so of course everyone thinks she 's guilty because there 's a piece of evidence that has n't come to light . Sam Neill is excellent as Michael Chamberlain , a Seventh-Day adventist pastor , who has doubts about his faith and perhaps about his wife . It 's good ( or bad ) to see that people are just as prejudiced and stupid elsewhere as they are in the States too , because the Australian public does n't believe the story and the media only fans the flames . Eventually , Lindy is found guilty and sent to prison for a life of hard labor , but years later , a missing piece of evidence shows up and she 's freed , but not until after the family 's life is basically ruined . A heart-breaking story , very well done , a bit long but well worth seeing . 8 out of 10 .
This was a great movie ! Even though there was only about 15 people including myself there it was great ! My friend and I laughed a lot . My mom even enjoyed it . There was two middle aged women there and a mid 20 year old there and they seemed to enjoy it . I love the part where Corky and Ned are like both liking Nancy and stuff its cute lol . And when she gets her roadster and Ned is there . Yeah This was a great movie even thought people underestimated it lol . Go See it i bet you 'll enjoy it ! ! I really enjoyed it and so did my friend . People were so tough on this movie and they had n't even seen it . I bet next time they will give the movie and actresses a chance . They all did a great job in my opinion . But if you have young kids its still appropriate . I will probably take my 7 year old niece to watch it too .
Street Fight is a brilliant piece of brutal satire . This is not a movie you just watch for fun . It is not a comfortable experience , although it does have some laugh-out-loud moments . This is a movie you watch when you need food for thought . To dismiss this film as simply racist is to miss the point entirely . This is not only a satire of Song of the South , it 's also a biting commentary on the prejudices that Americans still have as a society . Every ethnic group portrayed in the movie gets shown as grotesque caricatures of their stereotypes , which in turn are grotesque caricatures of real people . Through this wild exaggeration , the filmmaker shows just how absurd these tightly-held beliefs really are . If you 're the sort of person who 's willing to acknowledge the ugliness of the prevalent prejudices American culture still holds , and if you 're not afraid to look your own prejudices in the eye , this movie may be for you .
I just have to throw my two cents in . Relax , it 's a comedy . Yes for the most part the characters are broadly written and acted . I ca n't think of many comedies where they are n't . This is n't a new release , it 's out on video and airs on cable almost every week . Would I see it in a theater ? Sure , I did , when it first came out . It 's funny ... that should be enough . Even if I did n't like it at all I 'd still watch it on cable for Michael Keaton . He 's an underrated and under-appreciated actor . I ca n't think of another who is so capable in every genre . Nor can I think of one who 's as successful . A comedic actor who 's also an action star ( short lived but still ) , who 's also a romantic lead , who 's also a dramatic actor ; a villain and a hero . I ca n't think of any , at least not in Hollywood . Certainly none who have been successful at all those genres . I mean there 's Tom Cruise but to me he 's better at being Tom Cruise than becoming a character . However this is n't about Michael Keaton vs. Tom Cruise so I 'll move on . Gung Ho is worth renting , heck it 's worth buying since you can probably find it for $ 10.00 or less at stores like Wal-Mart . It 's worth watching on cable ( if you have cable or satellite ) . It 's one of those fun to watch movies . You can put your brain on pause , and just relax , and chuckle away . To ask for more , in my honest opinion , is asking too much .
After gorging myself on a variety of seemingly immature movies purchased on ex-rental DVDs , I figured that the time was right for a little serious drama and who better to provide it than Sam Mendes ? For a number of reasons , `` American Beauty '' does n't appeal to me as much as this film which is easily the darkest thing that Tom Hanks has ever done and probably one of the most underrated films of the last decade . For this is not a simple gangster tale lifted from its graphic novel origins , and is simply wonderful to watch because of it . And despite my usual allergy to any film with Tom Hanks ' name on it ( still ca n't watch `` Big '' without wanting a cat to kick ) , I 'm glad I gave this a try because this is one of those movies that you 'll kick yourself for if you miss it . Normally squeaky-clean Hanks plays Michael Sullivan , a devoted family man and father of two sons growing up during Prohibition in the early 1930 's . He is also a professional hit-man to mob boss John Rooney ( Paul Newman ) but has managed to keep his job a secret from his sons . But after his eldest ( Tyler Hoechlin ) witnesses his dad involved in a mob killing , the pair are forced to go on the run as John seeks to tidy the matter up . Soon , father and son are pursued to Chicago where a fellow hit-man ( a menacing Jude Law ) is waiting for them . On the face of it , it reads like a pretty standard gangster film but as I 've said , this is n't really about gangsters at all . It 's about the relationship between a father and son thrown together in the most tragic of circumstances . Hanks is ( *grits teeth* ) superb as the tortured man who finds out that everything has its price and little Hoechlin is also good as Sullivan 's son . In all honesty , there is not a single performance that I could single out as weaker than the others - the cast is pretty much faultless . As is the cinematography and costumes ( and it 's not often I praise costumes ! ) which recreates the 30 's with stunning effect . There has been so much effort to get everything right and it pays off in spades . This could easily have looked rubbish - they admit that the early 30 's look was difficult to put down - but it does n't and that deserves every bit of credit . Chicago especially looks fantastic , lined with hundreds of rickety cars from the era and filled with people in monochrome suits and hats . True time-travel , even if a little CGI is needed . The story is also a winner , offering a human face to what is often seen as a stereotypical genre of movie villain . Law is surprisingly menacing as the almost mechanical killer Maguire and proves that you do n't have to be Cagney or De Niro or Brando to play a gangster . The film is decidedly noir-ish , driving rain and ill-lit warehouses predominate but at least violence and killing are ( finally ) seen to have an emotional and psychological impact on those who perpetrate and those who merely witness such acts . The whole thing is evocative of a previous age and previous movies but it sweeps away the old and refreshes with a modern tale of redemption amid the Tommy-Gun shootouts and extortion rackets . It can feel a little slow in places , especially if you 're used to masses of gun-play in movies like most modern audiences ( like yours truly ) but sometimes , words can speak louder than actions . Mendes has delivered a fine follow-up to his Oscar-winning debut , a film which is as intelligent as it is beautiful to watch . `` Road To Perdition '' may not be to everyone 's tastes but this is one DVD I shall not be exchanging anytime soon .
This is a good family show with a great cast of actors . It 's a nice break from the reality show blitz of late . There is nothing else quite like it on television right now either , unless you count Joan of Arcadia as being similar because it has a teen lead character too . Anyway , Clubhouse is worth a look because Jeremy Sumpter gives the main character ( Pete Young ) a kind of likability and naiveté that is appealing without being overly sweet and cuddly . Dean Cain , Christopher Lloyd , Mare Winningham and Kirsten Storms round out the rest of the main cast members , and each is terrific in their role . I really like Kirsten Storms as Pete 's sister Betsy ; she is quite a pill , but she still cares about her mom and brother , even though she hates to show it . It may take a few episodes to really find it 's legs , but Clubhouse is easily one of the best shows to come along in a good long while , so check it out people -- you 'll be glad you did !
I think the deal with this movie is that it has about 2 minutes of really , really funny moments and it makes a very good trailer and a lot of people came in with expectations from the trailer and this time the movie does n't live up to the trailer . It 's a little more sluggish and drags a little slowly for such an exciting premise , and i think i 'm seeing from the comments people having a love/hate relationship with this movie . However , if you look at this movie for what it is and not what it could have been considering the talent of the cast , i think it 's still pretty good . Julia Stiles is clearly the star , she 's so giddy and carefree that set among the conformity of everyone else , she just glows and the whole audience falls in love with her along with Lee . The rest of the cast , of course , Lee 's testosterone-filled coworkers , his elegant mother-in-law , his fratlike friend Jim and his bride-to-be all do an excellent job of fitting into stereotypes of conformity and boringness that make Stiles stand out in the first place . Lee does n't live up to his costars , i do n't think , but you could view that as more that they 're hard to live up to . Maybe that 's one source of disappointment . The movie itself , despite a bit of slowness and a few jokes that do n't come off as funny as the writer 's intended , is still pretty funny and I found a rather intelligent film . The themes of conformity and `` taking the safe route '' seemed to cleverly align on several layers . For example , there was the whole motif of how he would imagine scenarios but would never act on them until the last scene , or how he was listening to a radio program on the highway talking about how everyone conforms , or just how everything selma blair and julia stiles ' characters said and did was echoed by those themes of one person being the safe choice and one being the risky choice . The other good thing about the movie was that it was kind of a screwball comedy in which Jason Lee has to keep lying his way through the movie and who through dumb luck ( example : the pharmacy guy turning out to be a good chef ) and some cleverness on his part gets away with it for the most part . While it was n't as funny as i expected and there was a little bit of squandered talent , but overall it 's still a good movie .
... intimate and specific . Yes , a bit of a cinderella story , but only after many convoluted turns , earning it 's way deeper and deeper into Antwone 's psyche . Only superficial viewing can condemn this film as superficial . This is the stuff that heals nations , this is one of our great national stories . Antwone 's path to emotional health encompasses a whole breadth of family history , the history of slavery and its aftermath . In his first directorial effort , first of many I hope , Denzel Washington confirms once again , that he has a truly beautiful mind and soul .
This docu-drama is what you would expect from Richard Attenborough , the man who gave us `` Gandhi '' : beautifully photographed , compellingly casted , well written in the measured , literate manner that Hollywood discarded in the 30 's , and scrupulously accurate . It stands out as a genre film , excelling in its portrayal of native American ( or , more appropriately for its Canadian setting , `` First Nations '' ) culture and standing with `` Black Robe '' as a wonderfully photographed piece of Canoe Country and its culture ( here , circa 1934 ) . This idyllic portrait derives drama from its subject : Archie `` Grey Owl '' Belaney , a Scot raised in Hastings ( England ) by maiden aunts who became so obsessed with the `` red indian '' tales of his childhood that he went to Canada , disappeared into the woods , and became a trapper and adopted son of an Ojibway band . He was a vain man with a habit of marrying and abandoning Indian brides , none of whom seem to have thought less of him for it , for he was also an extraordinarily charming and picaresque character . One of his wives ( one smarter than he , by most accounts ) propelled him into fame as a writer and early advocate for protecting the wild country of the North , and this forms the focus of Attenborough 's tale . The chemistry between Brosnan and Annie Galipeau ( as Grey Owl 's wife Pony ) is engaging and , if not firey , is nonetheless quite touching . A good film when you need some time from the madding crowd .
I love Ashley Judd and think all of her movies are great . Ruby in Paradise is one of her best . It is a very understated movie that you really have to watch close to appreciate it . A story of a woman trying to make it on her own and refusing to give in to temptations that would make her life easy . Some of her movies such as Kiss The Girls and Time to Kill probably did better at the box office and video rentals . They were very good movies also , but take the time to really look at Ruby and I think you will agree it is one of Ashley 's Best .
I do n't quite know how to explain `` Darkend Room , '' because to summarize it would n't really do it justice . It 's a quintessentially Lynchian short film with two beautiful girls in a strange , mysterious situation . I would say this short is definitely more on the `` Mulholland Drive '' end of the Lynchian spectrum , as opposed to `` The Elephant Man '' or `` The Straight Story . '' It 's hidden on Lynch 's website , and well worth the search .
So many educational films are nothing more than mind-numbing drudgery , saved only by the fact that `` MST3K '' mocks them ( `` Why Study Industrial Arts ? '' comes to mind ) . `` Hemo the Magnificent '' is actually quite well done . It 's all about blood , the heart , and the circulatory system . I admit that I do n't remember everything from it , but it does a good job explaining everything , keeping it serious but entertaining . I guess that you can always count on June Foray ( most famously the voice of Rocky the Squirrel , she plays a deer here ) . Since `` Hemo the Magnificent '' itself may be hard to find , probably the best place to see it is in `` Gremlins '' : a class is watching it while a gremlin is forming .
I read a few reviews of this TV movie which all said that the film dragged on for too long and that it was basically only sensationalistic entertainment . I agree that perhaps , the film goes on a bit too long ( 2h30 would have been enough ... ) but I certainly do not think it sensationalize the subject matter . Jim Jones ' expansive power trip and slow degradation into mental illness , paranoia and drug abuse are never treated in a voyeuristic manner . The movie takes its time in showing how Jones recruited followers ( Brenda Vaccaro 's and Brad Dourif 's character are stand-outs in that matter ) but also in observing an uncanny shift in Jones ' perception of reality . It is mind-boggling to see an egalitarian , left-wing and compassionnate preacher become such a destructive and cruel dictator . Perhaps the movie does n't explore Jones ' motivations enough , which can make the whole ordeal a bit superficial at times ( may have to do with censorship as well ... ) But Powers Boothe 's mesmerizing performance makes it all come true . I am not familiar with the details of the real Jim Jones ' life , but Boothe sure makes the monster he plays believable and real . The movie features many strong scenes , among them the preaching messes of Jones , Jones 's meeting with Father Divine ( a remarquable James Earl Jones ) , Congressman Leo Ryan ( Ned Beatty ) 's visit to the Guyana camp and of course , the suicide scene . It is quite a gloomy spectable to watch and Boothe is quite commanding in those last moments . Madge Sinclair shines in this scene as one of the suddenly sceptic follower , and so do Veronica Cartwright ( as Jones ' wife ) and Brad Dourif , especially when their time comes to drink the murderous potion . The relative calm of the end of this scene , the tasteful direction and the contrasting beauty of the natural surroundings all work in making those images quite impossible to erase from one 's mind . A disturbing reflection on human nature and its weaknesses . Worth watching , if only to keep in mind one of the truly horrific events of the 20th century . Not to let it be repeated again . Like , ironically , the inscription in Jim Jones ' camp : `` Those who do not know the past are bound to repeat it '' .
What 's Good About It : Some inventive and genuinely creepy little effects that will get under the skin of even the most seasoned horror fan . Does n't rely on the hackneyed soundtrack stabs for its `` gotcha '' moments . Even if you 've seen everything , there 's still a few things in this film that will make your jaw drop . What Could Have Been Better About It : The acting was , at times , flat and unconvincing . It had a `` shot-on-video '' quality in some places ( though , it mostly achieved the atmosphere it was striving for ) , and the camera work is full of needless close-ups of meaningless actions . Though the effects are genuinely creepy , I think they may have gone to the well a few too many times with some of them . The ending seemed rushed , and glossed over what could have been more impactful moments . The viewer is left to figure out a lot of things for themselves , not as a challenge by the filmmakers , but because they just missed it . Still , a good little indie horror film that is easily several steps above the average . Well worth the rental .
My first exposure to `` Whale Music '' was the Rheostatics album of the same name , that I bought around 1993 . I was reading the liner notes and the band said the album , which remains in a prominent place in my collection , was inspired by Canadian author Paul Quarrington 's book . I picked up the book a few months later and devoured it ! An amazing read ! I have since re-read the book numerous times , each time finding some new element to Desmond and his desire to complete the Whale Music . I found the film in 1996 , on video . I have n't had a lot of good experiences with Canadian film , but this one worked for me . The role of Claire could have been cast differently , but overall I think that Paul Quarrington 's vision was transfered nicely from the book to the screen . Maury Chaykin gives a moving performance as the isolated genius . The movie deals with family relationships , love , and finding someone who understands . I would strongly recommend `` Whale Music '' to not only music fans , but anyone who has ever lost something or someone , and tried to find their way back to the world .
This is the funniest stand up I have ever seen and I think it is the funniest I will ever see . If you do n't choke with laughter at the absolute hilarity , then this is just not your cup of tea . But I honestly do n't know anyone who has seen this that has n't liked it . It is now 17 years later and my friends and I still quote everything from Goonie Goo Goo to the fart game , Aunt Bunnie to the ice cream man , Ralph and Ed to GET OUT ! ! There are just so many individual and collective skits of hilarity in here that if you honestly have n't seen this film then you are missing out on one of the best stand-ups ever . Take any of Robin Williams , Damon Wayans , The Dice , George Carlin or even the greats like Richard Pryor or Red Foxx and this will surpass it . I do n't know how or where Murphy got some of his material but it works . That is what it comes down to . It is funny as hell . Could you imagine how this show must have shocked people that were used to Eddie doing Buckwheat and Mr. Rogers and such on SNL ? If you listen to the audience when he cracks his first joke or when he says the F-word for the first time , they are in complete shock . His first time he says the F-word is when he does the skit about Mr. T being a homosexual. `` Hey boy , hey boy . You look mighty cute in them jeans . Now come on over here , and f @ ** me up the ass ! '' The crowd erupts in gales of laughter . No one was expecting the filthy mouth that he unleashed on them . But the results were just awesome . I have never been barraged with relentless comedy the way I was in this stand-up . In fact , the next time my stomach hurt so much from laughing was n't until 1999 when I saw SOUTH PARK : BIGGER LONGER AND UNCUT . That comedy was raw and unapologetic and it went for the jugular , as did DELIRIOUS . I do n't think it is possible to watch this piece of comic history and not laugh . It is almost twenty years later and it is still the funniest damn thing on video. `` I took your kids fishing last week . And I put the worm on the hook and the kids put the fishing pole back in the boat and slammed their heads in the water for two minutes Gus . Normal kids do n't do shit like that Gus . Then they started movin their heads around like this and the m****f***** come up with fish . Then they looked at each other and said Goonie Goo Goo ! I said can you believe this f****n shit ? ! '' See it again and be prepared to laugh your freakin ass off ! 10 out of 10
This was one of the highlights of ST : TNG 's semi-forgettable second season , before they 'grew up ' or grew into their own in the third season and beyond . This was not only a showcase for up-and-comers like Bill Campbell and Teri Hatcher , but was also the continuation of Data 's search for his 'humanity ' , this time through the concept of comedy . Still one of my favorite episodes . On a side-note , I 'm still disappointed that there is no credit for the actress with whose character Okona was about to have a tryst ( after Teri Hatcher 's character ) before being rudely interrupted by Lt Worf . I remember watching this episode 'first-run ' at my friends comic shop back in the day and we all thought she would 've been a perfect Jean Grey/Marvel Girl . It would be nice to know who this pretty lady actually is ...
Soap Opera about a small town married woman ( Kay Francis ) who works at the local newsstand , performs as leading lady in her local playhouse , but dreams of becoming a star on Broadway . When a famous actor who is a ham , a windbag , and a womanizer to boot , arrives in town she visits him in his room with dreams of him giving her tips to stardom - he pretends his valet is his `` manager '' tricking her into believing she has all it takes but `` experience '' to become a big star . Her husband finds out and punches the guy resulting in the actor 's unexpected death - which leads to a murder trial and even more unexpected : a life prison sentence for hubby . Next thing you know she 's joined a traveling Burlesque show in hopes of one day making it to Broadway and making enough money to get her man 's freedom - all the while her baby is sleeping in a trunk ! This film has a pretty interesting plot , well , a bit far-fetched perhaps , but very melodramatic ( with tons of melodramatic music to make sure you get it ) - all *greatly* enhanced by the strong , emotional performance given by Kay Francis - she just makes this film . Also helping here is the well-done acting by Minna Gombell in her role as a `` getting close to forty '' older lady who works the burlesque and befriends Kay . Worth seeing , especially for Kay Francis fans .
Ronald Colman gives an electrifying performance as Tony John , a Broadway actor who ca n't separate his offstage life from Shakespeare 's Othello , the character he plays on stage ... .Two important scenes illustrate Tony 's dilemma . The first one takes place in producer Max Lasker 's office . Acting is a matter of talent for the practical-minded Lasker . But Donlan , Tony 's friend , disagrees : `` No , no . When you do it like Tony does it , it 's much more . The way he has of becoming someone else every night ... so completely . No , do n't tell me his whole system is n't affected by it . `` ... .The other scene occurs in waitress Pat Kroll 's apartment . Tony tells her his name is Martin . She thanks him . Then he says : `` Or Paul . Hamlet . Joe . And maybe Othello . `` ... .When Tony begins rehearsing Othello , we learn that though he 's trying to keep his real life separated from his stage life , `` The part begins to seep into your life , and the battle begins . Reality against imagination . '' He ca n't keep the two separated : In his mind Pat is Desdemona and he 's Othello , and he wrongly believes she has been unfaithful to him . He murders her ... .Colman 's bravura performance , in a complex and difficult role , earned him 1947 's Academy Award for Best Actor . Oscar nominations went to Ruth Gordon and Garson Kanin for Best Original Screenplay . Not to be overlooked is Milton Krasner 's atomspheric cinematography .
Full disclosure : I 'm a cynic . I like my endings sad and my hankies dry . I did n't cry when Bambi 's mother was shot . Will Smith 's new film Happiness looks like a desperate plea for an Oscar . Basically I was born without an artistic soul . So why on earth did I like `` 10 Items or Less ? '' Maybe it was the double espresso I downed before the show . Or ( more likely ) maybe it was that even the most hardboiled of movie fans could use an occasional shot of sweetness . And sweet it is . From the moment `` Him '' meets `` Scarlet '' ( an event far from a Nora Ephron `` meet cute '' ) the view is taken on an intimate journey with two strangers learning to care about where their lives are headed . ( Aided beautifully by Phedon Papamichael 's cinema verity style camera work . ) The main argument about the film is that it 's too far fetched . Is the film far fetched ? I do n't know . You tell me . I 've yet to meet Adrian Brody at the market . ( However , not for lack of trying ) . Do I enjoy considering the adventures that might occur should this momentous event take place ? Darn straight I do . . .that 's where most reviews of `` 10 Items or Less '' fall short . . .they fail to take into account that even we cynics have fantasies . And heck , sometimes , it 's worth the price of admission to vicariously live them , 82 minutes at a time .
In a little town in Montana two brothers grow up . One of them is Norman ( Craig Sheffer ) , the other is Paul ( Brad Pitt ) . Their father is Reverend Maclean and they grow up with his lessons that has to do with religion , and the lessons of fly-fishing . In this movie fly-fishing represents life , a little . The story is good and keeps your attention although there are some moments you need a little action . Probably the movie has this moments because it is not really about the events that happen , but about the message . Some things do happen though . Norman goes to Dartmouth to study . After six years he returns and gets involved with a nice girl named Jessie ( Emily Lloyd ) and he is invited to teach in Chicago . Paul has become a reporter and is known as the `` fishing reporter '' . He is famous and it seems he has a nice life , but he drinks a little too much and gambles too much . The movie is very well directed , it has a nice score and all of the actors are good . The most beautiful thing in this movie is the cinematography . The mountains , the woods and the river all look very beautiful . If the movie was only made for these things it was good enough to watch . Fortunately there is more .
This is the best version ( so far ) that you will see and the most true to the Bronte work . Dalton is a little tough to imagine as Rochester who Jane Eyre declared `` not handsome '' . But his acting overcomes this and Zelah Clark , pretty as she is , is also a complete and believable Jane Eyre . This production is a lengthy watch but well worth it . Nearly direct quotes from the book are in the script and if you want the very first true 'romance ' in literature , this is the way to see it . I own every copy of this movie and have read and re-read the original . The filming may seem a little dated now but there will never be another like this .
I have to say , Seventeen & Missing is much better than I expected . The perception I took from the previews was that it would be just humdrum but I was pleasantly surprised with this impressive mystery . Dedee Pfeiffer is Emilie , a mom who insists her daughter , Lori ( Tegan Moss ) , not attend a so-called graduation party one weeknight , but Lori ignores her mother 's wishes and takes off for the party anyway . When Lori does not come home , Emilie knows something is wrong and she begins to have visions of her daughter and the events that led to her disappearance . Seventeen & Missing is better than so many other TV movies of this type , as it is not so predictable . Pfeiffer is the reason to see this movie , and most of it comes off as believable . This LMN Original Movie premiered last night . 10/10
If you were ever sad for not being able to get a movie on DVD , it was probably 'Delirious ' you were looking for . How often do you laugh when watching stand up comedy routines ? I was too young to see Richard Pryor during his greatest time , and when I was old enough to see Eddie Murphy 's 'Delirious ' and 'Raw ' ( not as funny ) I never knew where Eddie got a big part of his inspiration . Now that I 'm older , and have seen both Pryor and many of the comedians after Murphy , I realize two things : Everybody STEALS from Eddie , while Eddie LOVINGLY BORROWED from Richard . That 's the huge difference : Eddie was original , funny , provocative , thoughtful  and more . He was something never before seen . He was all we ever needed . These days Eddie Murphy is boring and old  but once upon a time he was The King , and 'Delirious ' was the greatest castle ever built . Truly one of the funniest routines of all time .
I really enjoyed the detail that went into the script . Jonathan Rhys Myers ( misspelled ) and Jewel were outstanding in their support roles . As was Jeffery Wright . Toby McGuire gave as fine a acting job as ever depicted , when he had to amputate his best friend 's arm , knowing he would die without the procedure . Attention to detail , with good dialect coaching to catch the Southern accent incredibly well . Why this movie was swept under the rug by the Hollywood promoters I can only imagine . I have strong suspicions . Which makes it all the more appealing to me . I have given a dozen DVD copies out for presents . Completely overlooked movie . Rent or buy it and give it your full attention for a couple of hours , then judge .
Watching Before The Devil counts as one of my all time best experiences at the cinema . I have been intrigued my the mixed response to the film - and for me , the extremes of opinion indicate the film touched on something either embraced or disavowed by the general audience . It is one of those films that has stayed with me , and I continue to ponder and think about it . Surely the DVD would illuminate some more of the themes and the film-making elements ? Which include : Sidney Lumet 's comeback movie , the time-shifting technique deployed in the storytelling , the superb combination of Lumet and Masterson and why it works so well , the masterly direction , the relatively rare focus Hollywood movies give to male characters and their largely doomed struggle to become an open cheque book for their women , the under-presented , but nevertheless resonant Marisa Tomei 's performance , and , of course , the superb Hoffman with that central monologue about the sum of his parts - for me the heart of the movie . Phew ! Surely a masterful film . So imagine my disappointment watching the eagerly anticipated DVD - only to find no commentary , no behind-the-scenes , no interviews , no extras . Hey - distributors - sort it out !
Other commentators have detailed the plot and the social parables and commentary as well ( or better ) that I could , but I would like to join in my admiration for this little jewel of a film . It holds up very well indeed more that 50 years later in every category - screenplay , acting , photography , set design , sound design ... it really is a classic of sorts . This was my first exposure to the `` young '' Alec Guinness , and it 's obvious from the first frames what made him so special as to eventually receive a knighthood . I only rate it an `` 8 '' because it 's essentially a rather lightweight parable that examines human nature but does n't really skewer it ; and because the plot takes the easy way out at the end , rather than actually resolving conflict between the inventor and the mill workers and industrialists who are chasing him all over town . Also , a couple minutes of thought reveals the basic flaw in the logic of the screenplay - wear and tear is hardly ever the determining factor in buying new clothes ( especially dress clothes ) ; children grow up , people change sizes , gain and lose weight , and go with the latest fashions all the time , and have as long as looms have woven cloth . And if nothing else , the manufacturer would make a fortune providing indestructible material for military uniforms ( especially BDUs ) . Still , this is a great film . If you get a chance to see it on a classic movie channel , you should .
Should this be an American movie I 'd rate it 7 : we 've seen this before . Being this an Argentinean movie , and being myself Argentine , I 'd like to give it a 10 , since it 's the kind of quality I 'd been hoping -rather than expecting- for . It 's superb quality is astonishing , given all the limitations imposed by the 3rd World ... I ca n't forget the scene when Díaz forces Silverstein 's fiancé to confess -you know what I mean if you saw the movie . I think that 's the key moment of the movie , not surprising maybe , yet original . That 's when the real action begins . Before watching a movie I always try to gather some previous information . Being this a mainstream , satyric , commercial one , I press `` Play '' and make a suspension of reality and logic , I 'd say the best state of mind to enjoy movies like this . It 's impossible to discuss the plausibility of the whole plot , yet it 's believable in a certain way . As for me , I could n't stop laughing at every single joke and commentary - '' sos malo '' ( `` you 're mean '' ) ... put in the mouth of Díaz , the greatest one . I 'm rather tired of seeing movies `` designed for '' Peretti . I know he 's a superb actor , but sometimes I feel his roles unfairly opaque the rest , Luis Luque 's role in this case . I 'm not very fond of Argentine television , so I have n't seen much work from Luque , but it 's pretty obvious that he 's an excellent performer . His physical role , his stares , his content attitude in this movie made me fall in love with his performance . I think his role should need some upgrading , just to let him show us how great he can be ! I do n't know whether Szifrón is planning to make a sequel or not . I know he wo n't make it if it 's to follow the rule that `` second parts were never good '' , so if he makes it , I 'll surely go see it . And I hope that , in the future , takes into account the possibility to give Peretti 's counterparts the same chances to develop their roles . Great movie , great performances , and lots of laughs !
I first heard of this movie after purchasing the 1976 flick `` Snuff '' . I was told that Devil 's Experiment was much better so naturally I went ahead and ordered the Guinea Pig box set . I was really interested to hear that Charlie Sheen had come out trying to ban either this movie or the second one , so my interest was peaked . Devil 's Experiment is a short film with no story , no character development . Just 3 men torturing a woman for about 45 minutes . They torture her in various ways like beating her , spinning her in circles over and over again then forcing her to drink alcohol , forcing her to listen to hi-pitched noise for 24 hours , smash her hand with a mallet , burning and putting maggots on the burns , throwing guts at her , and ultimately shoving a sharp needle through her eye . I must say that a lot of this movie was fake , like the beating scenes . But then , some of it was actually well done as far as grossing you out . The scenes in which the woman is being spun around in circles was making me dizzy watching it . Or the scene in which she is forced to listen to sharp noise for 24 hours is painful to think about . The worst is the eye scene . I did n't shutter when watching it but simply thought `` Damn , that looks pretty good for such a low budget movie '' . I did enjoy the flick but I do n't know if I can really recommend this unless you have seen most of what the horror genre has to offer . 7/10
TIllman Jr. 's drama about the first African American Navy Master Diver ( Gooding Jr. ) , who defies all odds and achieves his goals despite a strict embittered trainer . The screenplay is not bad , a bit extreme at times , but the direction and acting is first-rate , and this film is inspiring and achieves what its supposed to do . I liked DeNiro in the lead , although its not on par with his masterful works ( taxi driver , godfather and all the others ) it is as good as his other good performances such as in King of Comedy or Angel Heart . DeNiro is always convincing and believable here , very good performance , Gooding Jr. is not bad , definitely one of his better performances . -- - IMDb Rating : 6.6 , my rating : 9/10
Once again Jet Li brings his charismatic presence to the movie screen in the film Black Mask . In this film Li plays Tsui , an escapee from a super soldier program who seeks to regain the humanity that the program had taken away from him . To do this Tsui decides to become a librarian in order to live a normal and peaceful life , but fate demands that he clean up problems from his past before he can continue to seek peace . Other members of the super soldier program had escaped at the same time as Tsui , but they want to get even with the world rather than find inner peace . Thus Tsui becomes the only thing that can prevent his former team mates from releasing information that could cost many innocent people their lives . This film screams across the screen at a frantic pace and never lets its audience go . The martial arts is amazing , but because it uses wires it may not be appreciated as much as it deserves by American audiences . If you like action movies that have an interesting story and demand good acting performances because they deal with psychological as well as physical conflicts , then Black Mask is for you . I am glad to see that some of Jet Li 's movies are finally getting main stream release in the United States and look forward to seeing how the changes that that release will require ( things like dubbing and soundtrack ) will affect the film . This is one of Li 's best films , go out and see it on May 14 when it is released in America .
If one would see a René Clair film with the kind of distracted semi-attention which is the rule in TV watching - one might be better off doing something different . Watching `` Le Million '' with all attention focused upon what takes place before eyes and ears will reveal a wealth of delightful details which keep this musical comedy going from the beginning to the end with its explosion of joy . In the Danish newspaper Berlingske Tidende a journalist once wrote : `` In my younger days I saw a film which made me feel like dancing all the way home from the cinema . This film is on TV tonight - see it ! ''
Anarchy and lawlessness reign supreme in the podunk hick hamlet of Elk Hills . The town elders deputize tough , cagey Vietnam veteran Aaron ( a wonderfully robust and engaging performance by Kris Kristofferson ) and several of his fellow vet buddies to clean up the place . The plan goes sour when Aaron and his cruel cronies decide to take over Elk Hills after they get rid of all the bad elements . It 's up to Aaron 's decent do-gooder brother Ben ( amiably played by Jan-Michael Vincent ) to put a stop to him before things get too out of hand . Writer/director George ( `` Miami Blues , '' `` Gross Pointe Blank '' ) Armitage whips up a delightfully amoral , cynical and wickedly subversive redneck drive-in exploitation contemporary Western winner : he expertly creates a gritty , no-nonsense tone , keeps the pace brisk and unflagging throughout , and stages the plentiful action scenes with considerable muscular aplomb ( the rousing explosive climax is especially strong and stirring ) . The first-rate cast of familiar B-feature faces constitutes as a major asset : Victoria Principal as Ben 's sweet hottie girlfriend Linda , the fabulous Bernadette Peters as flaky saloon singer Little Dee , Brad Dexter as the feckless mayor , David Doyle as a slimy bank president , Andrew Stevens as an affable gas station attendant , John Carpenter movie regular Charles Cyphers as one of the 'Nam vets , Anthony Carbone as a smarmy casino manager , John Steadman as a folksy old diner owner , Paul Gleason as a mean strong-arm shakedown bully , and Dick Miller as a talentless piano player . Moral : Do n't hire other people to do your dirty work . William Cronjager 's slick cinematography , Gerald Fried 's lively , harmonic hillbilly bluegrass score , and the abundant raw violence further add to the overall trashy fun of this unjustly neglected little doozy .
I thoroughly enjoyed the first part of this two parter , The Impossible Planet , and was slightly worried that the second part would n't hold up quite so well as has been true in the past of the two parters of the past 2 Who series . But thankfully my fears were unfounded as I found myself enjoying this episode as much as the previous one . Anyway we start off with the surviving crew members on the run from the Ood , whom have become the Devil 's pawn . There is also a bit of philosophizing on the Doctor 's part in the episode that I quite enjoyed . Needless to say it was a good solid Doctor Who story . Might be a tad too intense for the younger viewers though . My Grade : B+
after seeing this excellent film over 100 times , i still find new things that blow me away with this movie , great special effects , incredible acting , and a plot full of ingenious twists makes this movie an excellent depiction of capitalism versus communism , and in this ending everyone is happy and all is well . best movie ever ! ! !
John Candy 's Performance in Once Upon A Crime is possibly his best ever . It 's been My Favourite Movie since it came out . I Spent 5 Years searching for it . That 's How Good It Is . If You Disagree , well , that 's your opinion . Enjoy The Movie .
Overall , I agree wholly with Ebert 's review . In a sense , I feel that I should not even be commenting since it is so much a vet 's movie and I am not a vet ( I was a resister ) . The flaw is that Martha is badly underdeveloped and does not act consistently . My guess is that Stephen Metcalfe is a vet himself and spent too little planning time on her character .
Hal Hartley 's Henry Fool was an independent film masterpiece and certainly his best work . It has immense character depth , subtle , complicated dialogue , and an excellent , emotional ending which captivates . I remember pausing it several times during my first viewing to absorb what I was seeing and feeling . Henry Fool was a complete movie from start to finish , and needed no sequel . Thus I was surprised when I heard about Fay Grim . Fay was not one of the main characters of the first film and seemed to exist more as the troubling imposition of real-world vanity and ignorance for her brother Simon to be forced to deal with as he matures . In her own movie , Fay matures herself , though her maturity takes a very different road . Simon went from near autistic isolation to a merely somewhat-introverted genius . Fay starts her adult journey as an immature , utterly normal , spoiled child and responds to the onslaught of ridiculous circumstances by becoming a mature , utterly normal , experienced adult who holds no advantages . She deals with problems the way any human does , with determination , a little thought , and weary disdain . While Simon learned to control his mind , Fay learns to control her emotion . The movie contains several fondly remembered elements of its prequel , but differs vastly in tone for most of the film . Henry fool showed you a harsh , boring , ignorant world which contrasted with Simon 's inner passion and creativity . In Fay Grim , the world is a lively , crazy , emotional place which shows the silliness of her young life , and through contrast unearths the inner wise woman which had not been previously developed or nurtured by her similarly weak mother . The movie is in two parts , the first dealing with the beginning of Fay 's struggle and subsequent hardening due to authoritarian hostility , and the second dealing with her battle to soften only just enough to regain Henry . At first , fans of Henry Fool may find themselves wondering how the movie can even be considered a sequel , and thinking it is profane to follow such an intense film with spy game antics and physical comedy . But this is where the subtlety of Fay Grim lies . The sequel is about Fay 's journey , and as I said before , hers is one of finding the life-giving sanity in chaos , not the creative chaos in staid order . Parker Posey is an excellent actress who captures Hal Hartley 's tongue in cheek humor perfectly . Elina Löwensohn perhaps eclipses her in emotional commitment to the role , allowing Parker to play both straight man and comic against the lively , stage-like comedy happening around her . With the entrance of Henry into the picture , the movie begins to take a sobering turn . Hal Hartley 's movies are all plays , and every play must come full circle . By the end , you are shown Fay 's newly developed character and integrity are the offspring of her time with the fatally intense Henry , whose piercing honesty and unique passion lights a spark in anyone he meets . Fay Grim is an excellent movie which does not surpass Henry Fool , but shows through Hal 's range that the nuances of his art are the proof of his genius . Honestly , I think anyone who bashes this movie not only missed the point by a mile ( and especially the subtlety in Parker Posey 's acting ) , but could not have been much interested the movie Henry Fool .
`` La Maman et la putain '' is the beautifulest film of all time . And what 's most moving about it may be the relation between reality and art the movie deals with , which is directly inspired by Proust 's `` A la Recherche du temps perdu '' . Indeed , `` La Maman et la putain '' and `` In search of lost time '' apparently tell the same story : the one of the failure of love , which repeats itself endlessly . The first woman 's name is always Gilberte , and the second woman appears like a twisted and deformed double of Gilberte : Veronika is like a `` whore Gilberte '' , beautiful like the night , whereas Gilberte was pure , and `` beautiful like the day '' . After the failure of the first love , a second love begins , but this one is like already doomed by the first one . Veronika takes the place of Gilberte , in Alexandre 's life and in the movie . She progressively eclipses her , first by time to time , Gilberte 's still coming when Alexandre waits for Veronika , then totally . That shows it 's the same sad story repeating itself , the same `` unfaithful woman '' , like Alexandre says , who appears endlessly - and unfaithful is for Proust the higher point in love , which makes it exist , but which also underlines its illusions . Art is what causes the passage between what 's outside - the illusion of love - to what 's inside , which is the truth , and is a learning of this truth . For instance , when Veronika notices the strange way Alexandre makes is bed , he answers that he saw it in a movie , and then , that a movie , `` it 's made for that , to learn how to live , how to make a bed '' . Alexander wants to live like he was in a film , he wants his life to be art . This conception of art comes from Proust , with whom Eustache shares the same rejection of `` political art '' and realism in art . `` La Maman et la putain '' fights against a conception of art `` principaly political '' - see for example the ironical review of a political movie by Alexandre . Like Proust says : `` Art does n't care for all this proclamations , and only exists in silence . '' First of all , art is introspection . And that also why realism or naturalism is rejected : art needs to transform reality to exist . Proust writes : `` I discover the illusion of realism , which is a lie '' . That 's why `` La Maman et la putain '' does n't hide its artificiality , underlines by the way the actors `` say '' their text : `` the more you seem artificial , the higher you go '' , said Eustache . Eustache and Proust both share this idea that the artist is a `` translater '' of a inner truth . But , Alexandre failed where Eustache succeed . `` La Maman et la putain '' tells us the failure of a character to be what he truly is . You can sens the tragedy arise when you go further in the movie , which becomes saddest . You can see it in the face of Alexandre , who looks more and more like a living-dead . You can see it by the fact that the scenes become longer , and that after a while , nothing happens outside . At the end of the movie , when you see Alexandre writing , and Veronika asking if he 's writing his life , you can guess that he 's not , that even literature failed . The end of the movie shows the symbolic death of Alexander , who is smashes by the heaviness of reality . And in this tiny nurse 's room , Alexandre looks more like Albertine than Marcel . To explain this failure , we can say that Alexandre is a Balzac 's reader . In `` Forme et signification '' , Jean Rousset explains that , in Proust 's , the readers of Balzac , who are Swann and Charlus , are unable of any artistic creation , because they 're stuck in reality , which they mistake with art . They see reality in art and `` are not aware of the transformations that necessarily exist between the life of an artist and his work , between reality and art '' . And that 's exactly Alexandre . He claims for instance that he `` loves a woman for parallel reasons , because she played in a Bresson 's for example '' . He 's like Swann , who falls in love with Odette because she looks like a Botticelli 's woman . `` Life is perhaps not my vocation '' . This thought is indeed by Eustache , who committed suicide , even if it 's said by Alexandre . Nevertheless , there is a difference between Alexandre and Eustache : if Eustache is absolutely Alexandre , Alexandre is like a double without art , a horrible vision of the artist , which crystallizes his fears . By fallowing Veronika at the end of the movie , Alexandre is condemned to illusions . It 's death that remind me the last frames of the movie , in the face of Jean-Pierre Léaud as well as in the endless pucking of Veronika . Or maybe it is already hell that describes the end , like in Sarte 's `` Huit-Clot '' , and absolutely not like in the final liberation of `` Le Temps retrouvé '' . If Eustache had read Proust , Alexandre could never have finish the book , always perturbed by life and Veronika when he tries to read it at his apartment or in the cafés . `` La Maman et la Putain '' is like a inverse double of `` In search of lost times '' , which tells how Alexander does n't become an artist , whereas `` A la Recherche du temps perdu '' tells how Marcel becomes a writer ( Genette ) . If , like Baudelaire says , an artiste tells `` reality at the light of his dream '' , it is his nightmare that Eustache tells us in `` La Maman et la putain '' .
1991 saw the release of the two best sequels of all time : TERMINATOR 2 : JUDGMENT DAY and BILL & TED 'S BOGUS JOURNEY . Out of the two , I 've always liked BILL & TED 'S BOGUS JOURNEY a bit better . TERMINATOR 2 : JUDGMENT DAY is the better made , but there 's just nothing like Bill and Ted . Besides Chris Farley and David Spade in TOMMY BOY , it 's hard to think of a greater comedic duo than Bill and Ted . They are one of a kind . Seemingly influenced by National Lampoon 's O.C . and Stiggs , Bill and Ted were created by Ed Solomon and Chris Matheson , two incredibly talented writers who invented the duo while performing at a local theater in L.A. back in the 1980s . The two quickly began writing a screenplay about two and before long BILL & TED 'S EXCELLENT ADVENTURE was born . The film , shot in 1987 and released in 1989 , became a big box office success and an instant cult classic . It was n't long before work began on the sequel . Stephen Herek , the director of 'EXCELLENT ADVENTURE ' was n't keen on working on the sequel since he considered it to be too mean-spirited and unlike the first one so Peter Hewitt , making his feature film debut , was brought in to direct the sequel . There could n't have been a better director for the job . BILL & TED 'S BOGUS JOURNEY is marvelously directed . It 's filled with its own unique style and energy that ca n't be matched . What makes 'BOGUS JOURNEY ' one of the best sequels ever is that it while it is darker than the original , it is just as fun . It does n't change the characters like most sequels do . Bill and Ted are the same lovable characters that they were in the first film . This is because it was written by the original writers . Most sequels are not written by the same writers as the first one , but since 'BOGUS JOURNEY ' had the same screenwriters , it ended up being just as good as 'EXCELLENT ADVENTURE ' if not even better . Just like the first one , 'BOGUS JOURNEY ' is absolutely hilarious , well written , fun , and above all , original . It 's filled with spectacular special effects and fantastic comedic performances from Alex Winter , Keanu Reeves , and William Sadler . It 's an unforgettable 'journey ' . 10/10
The late 30s and early 40s were a golden age for adventure movies , what with the rise in budgets during the economic recovery , the changes to screen entertainment since the production code became enforced and the general carefree optimism of the times . While most of these were rip-roaring swashbucklers about the wild , superhuman and often frankly misogynistic exploits of heartthrobs like Errol Flynn and Tyrone Power , Gunga Din is very different in its focus , scope and tone . Part of Gunga Din 's secret is the division of labour in its writing team . The original story is by Ben Hecht and Charles MacArthur , two of the most skilled and celebrated writers of Hollywood 's golden age . However the actual screenplay was the work of Joel Sayre and Fred Guiol , both of whom , Guiol especially , had a background in comedy . What we get from these four is a plot that is well-balanced and engaging , yet also cleverly spiced up with comical touches . Most of the adventure flicks of this time were at least partly comedies , usually featuring one or two comic-relief supporting players , but they did n't use laughs in the way Gunga Din does . Here , all the main characters are capable of being objects or originators of jokes . We see the sinister menace of the bad guys suddenly diffused as the scene dissolves into a light-hearted brawl . The first main battle scene is an even-handed blend of action and gags , in the style of the silent swashbucklers of Douglas Fairbanks , Sr. , something which the Flynn and Power vehicles largely failed to replicate . Towards the middle of Gunga Din the action must necessarily take a break and there are lots of talky scenes for the sake of the plot . However the continual forays into comedy  such as the spiked punch routine  make this `` slow '' portion bearable . Producer-director George Stevens was a natural when it came to this sort of thing , himself having cut his teeth at the Hal Roach studios , and almost exclusively having directed comedy up to this point . This was his first full-on action feature , and he does a startlingly good job . In particular his use of moving point-of-view shots make the battle scenes extra exhilarating . He also brings something you seldom see in action pictures of this era  a sense of real dread and fear . He sets this up with those stark and foreboding mountains dominating many of the shots and dwarfing the characters . The portrayal of the abandoned village and the Thuggee cultists cry of `` Kali ! '' is genuinely haunting . This dimension of fear plays into all the other emotions that are at work here , causing us to worry for these likable characters , and making the comedy a greater relief of tension . A real touch of genius is in the way the eponymous hero is introduced to the audience . We are made aware of Din visually , as he is prominent in a number of scenes before any of the characters actually address him or verbally refer to him . Because of this , we are given the impression that Din is not an important figure within the regiment , but he quickly becomes a notable character to us , and crucially a sympathetic one , as we see him risking his life and giving water to dying men . But the best efforts of writers and directors are all for nought without a capable cast . Fear not , for Gunga Din has a top-notch one ! Victor McLaglan and Cary Grant were ideally suited to the material , since their best roles were generally found somewhere on the spectrum between drama and comedy . Grant in particular is at his best , largely believable but just occasionally breaking into that over-the-top whooping and capering that was his trademark . Douglas Fairbanks , Jr. is not quite up to the standard of his heavyweight companions , but he is by no means bad . And of course there is Sam Jaffe , cursed by his looks to forever play these wizened little oddballs , but who else could play them with such dignity and humanity ? I have not set out to bash the swashbuckling adventures of Errol Flynn and Tyrone Power , and indeed many of their pictures are absolute classics that I love absolutely . But Gunga Din does things that even the best of those swashbucklers could never achieve . Not only does it dispense with the dashing male lead or the clichéd defiant damsel , it successfully merges the action genre with comedy and poignancy , in a way that few pictures have done before or since . And that 's fabulous .
Being a big fan of the romantic comedy genre , and therefore having seen a large number of these films , it is rare that one strikes me as totally unique . For that matter , it is equally rare that I am gasping for breath through the laughter during several scenes . The love story is a little thin on the ground , but I 'd say that 's probably for the best , as this romantic comedy has the emphasis firmly on `` comedy '' , and in any case it stretches the bounds of credibility just a little more than I like most rom com 's to do . The four scientists provided some of the funniest moments not just in this film , but in any film I 've seen in a long while . I hesitated for the briefest of moments before finally choosing a `` 10 '' over a `` 9 '' as a rating , as I believe that far too many people use it indiscriminately , and therefore the maximum rating loses some of its impact . I 'm also a big Meg Ryan fan , which helps , but this is one of the few films I 've seen in which I 'd say she is comprehensively overshadowed . She and Tim Robbins are cast as the leads , but for me play second fiddle to the antics of the bumbling intellectuals . A genuine laugh-out-loud type film .
Big rock candy mountain is amazing . i watched it when i was little , and still do to this day .

I 'll be quick to address the matters of the film here : It was a very engaging story about the destructive qualities about all-consuming passions ; a young Italian woman who can not emotionally connect with her jailed political-radical fiancé ( due in part to her apolitical attitudes and freewheeling approach to life ) finds solace and passion in a new young lover whom she embarks on an explicitly sexual relationship with . The anxieties , rage , tenderness and passions that swirl around in the atmosphere of the story equal the dispassionate quiet that seems to engulf the two leads . It lends the film an unsettling mood that permeates through all the political strife that is otherwise lost on the viewer ( unless you have a deep knowledge of Italian politics during the 80 's ) . I found the film compelling ... what ruined it somewhat is a gratuitous oral sex scene that the actress performs on the male lead ... it is n't simulated and leaves little to the imagination . There are other scenes of sex in the film , which I do feel were necessary because they outline the madness and loneliness that the characters live in . But the oral sex scene , I feel , derails the focus on the actual story . It was smooth sailing up until that point and once the infamous sex scene appears ( which caused much hoopla back in its day ) , it 's like hitting a roadblock . It 's jarring and unnecessary and I am in the camp that believes that the film would not have been harmed any if the scene had been removed from it . And what 's unfortunate is that this particular scene may deter people from watching this intriguing film , which I believe is worth a viewing because there is so much going on underneath the surface , emotions and further turmoils layered in the subtext . Overall : Wonderful film hampered by a much not-needed sex scene .
Anyone who does n't laugh all through this movie has been embalmed . I have watched it at least twenty times and I still get tears in my eyes at many of the scenes . Sally Field is absolutely perfect as Celest Talbert , a fading soap star whose supporting cast is trying to get her replaced in hopes that their own star will rise . Fields , at 45 , still has that wonderful and beautiful pixie quality and a perfect figure that belies her having had three children . I 'm biased , I 'm in love with her . The cast of `` Soapdish '' is filled with stars who perform their roles to perfection . Kevin Kline is flawless , as are Robert Downey Jr. , an ingénue Elizabeth Shue , Whoopi Goldberg , Teri Hatcher in one of her early roles , Carrie Fisher as the oversexed casting director who auditions an actor for a small part as a waiter without his shirt on . Kathy Najimy is wonderful as the hapless costume designer , and best of all , Cathy Moriarty as Nurse Nan who leads the plot to get Fields character removed from the show is hilarious . This movie should have won Oscars for best comedy , best leading lady in a comedy , best leading man in a comedy and myriad other bests , including writing , directing and supporting actors and actresses . Get the DVD so you can watch it over and over for the next twenty five years . You will still be laughing at it when the disc wears out .
This is according to me a quite bizarre movie with a lot of humor in it . I would n't say that it is very scary , but more fun I guess . That is if you like horror movies . Scarecrow kind of remembered me of `` Children of the corn '' , but still not . If you compare these two movies this is much more fun to watch = )
I think Charlotte Gainsbourg is one of the best performers in the world . I ca n't understand why some people say she 's not . Boring ... . ? ? ? Maybe the one who said she 's boring is because he/she is boring . She 's a great actress and the movie was excellent . It has lots of wonderful ideas and very good performers . The direction was great . I imaging myself in the French environment with all the sophistication and perfume , flowers , churches , problems , etc . When she goes to the sister 's shop is simply amazing . Everything 's great . We have a very good actress , wonderful , for long time . Alain Chabat and Bernadette Lafont are perfect . I like him more than in his next movie LA SCIENCE DES RÊVES . And Eric Lartigau did a very good work . Ana
This entertainingly tacky'n'trashy distaff `` Death Wish '' copy stars the exceptionally gorgeous and well-endowed brunette hottie supreme Karin Mani as Billie Clark , a top-notch martial arts fighter and one woman wrecking crew who opens up a gigantic ten gallon drum of ferocious chopsocky whup-a** on assorted no-count scuzzy muggers , rapists , drug dealers and street gang members after some nasty low-life criminals attack her beloved grand parents . The stunningly voluptuous Ms. Mani sinks her teeth into her feisty butt-stomping tough chick part with winningly spunky aplomb , beating jerky guys up with infectious glee and baring her smoking hot bod in a few utterly gratuitous , but much-appreciated nude scenes . Unfortunately , Mani possesses an extremely irritating chewing-on-marbles harsh and grating voice that 's sheer murder on the ears ( my favorite moment concerning Mani 's dubious delivery of her dialogue occurs when she quips `` Do n't mess with girls in the park ; that 's not nice ! '' after clobbering a few detestable hooligans . The delectable Karin 's sole subsequent film role was in `` Avenging Angel , '' in which she does a truly eye-popping full-frontal nude scene , but does n't have any lines . ) The film 's single most sensationally sleazy sequence transpires when Mani gets briefly incarcerated on a contempt of court charge and shows her considerably substantial stuff in a group prison shower scene . Of course , Mani 's lascivious lesbian cell mate tries to seduce her only to have her unwanted advances rebuffed with a severe beatdown ! Strangely enough , the lesbian forgives Mani and becomes her best buddy while she 's behind bars . Given an extra galvanizing shot in the vigorously rough'n'ready arm by Edward Victor 's punchy direction , a funky-rockin ' score , endearingly crummy acting by a game ( if lame ) cast , a constant snappy pace , numerous pull-out-all-the-stops exciting fight scenes , and Howard Anderson III 's gritty photography , this immensely enjoyable down'n'dirty exploitation swill is essential viewing for hardcore fans of blithely low-grade low-budget grindhouse cinema junk .
Erich Rohmer 's `` L'Anglaise et le duc '' makes a perfect companion piece to Peter Watkins ' `` La Commune ( Paris 1871 ) . '' Both films -screened at this year 's Toronto International Film Festival- ironically illustrate how history is shaped to by the tellers of the tale . Ironic , given the tragic events that were taking place in the U.S. during the festival . Set in Paris during the French Revolution , the movie , based on Grace Elliott 's ( Lucy Russell ) `` Memoirs , '' is a first-hand account of how she survived those heady but dangerous days . She also details her relationship with The Duke of Orleans ( played by Jean-Claude Dreyfus ) , who , in contrast to herself , is a supporter of the Revolution . True to form , you do n't know whose side of history Rohmer is going to come down on . One of the earliest of the French `` New Wave '' filmmakers , Rohmer has often been criticized for being too conservative . After all , in the midst of the rebelling-youth-Viet-Nam days of the late 60s and 70s , he was filming romantic little confections like `` Claire 's Knee . '' But do n't sell the old boy short , folks , he 's always been a student of human nature , not an ideologue , and `` L'Anglaise et le duc '' continues to bear this out . Rohmer 's characters are never the `` bad guys '' nor the `` good guys ' ; they are first and foremost human beings who are capable of exhibiting a full range of human potentialities -and limitations . That 's why his movies are always provocative , and this film is no exception . Now for the technological nuts and bolts . Rohmer , though making his way into his 80s , is still on the cutting-edge of cinematic innovation . The look of `` L'Anglaise '' is like something you 've never seen before . You guessed it , the old guy -like several of the festival 's directors this year- has gone digital . All of the movie 's exterior scenes look as though they are taking place in their original 1780s Parisian settings . As a matter of fact , you may get so distracted from marveling at the authenticity of the film 's look you may have to go back for a second screening to catch the subtleties of the film 's psychological -and yes , I 'll say it- political insights . Toronto features some of the world 's edgiest young filmmakers this year , as well as some of the world 's oldest . And the old masters are standing there on cinema 's cutting-edges right alongside the young ones . Long live youth . Long live old age . And long live Erich Rohmer .
With the advent of the IMDb , this overlooked movie can now find an interested audience . Why ? Because users here who do a search on two-time Academy Award winner Glenda Jackson can find 'The Return of The Soldier ' among her credits . So can those checking out Oscar winner Julie Christie . Fans of Ann-Margret can give the title a click , as will those looking into the career of the great Alan Bates . Not to mention the added bonus of a movie with supporting heavyweights Ian Holm and Frank Finlay . Any movie with so many notables in it is rewarded by the IMDb , given all the cross-referencing that goes on here . So , why is n't this movie out on DVD ? Do n't the Producers realize the Internet Movie Database is a marketing gift for such a film ? And 'The Return of The Soldier ' is definitely a gem waiting to be discovered . Get with it , people .
We all create our own reality , or do we ? That is the core question behind this highly original and masterfully crafted examination of the illusionary nature of reality . Blending Eastern and Buddhist philosophies with the visual chicanery of M.C . Escher , this fascinating treatise manages to take on the rather cerebral question of ` Who are we and what is our place in the universe ? ' , and turn it into a captivating and fun-filled 100 minutes . The film centers on Bart , a writer struggling with his screenplay , ` The Sea That Thinks . ' As he sits at his computer , the work begins to unfold as nothing more than a description of his sitting at the computer , writing the screenplay . Before long he is stuck in a whirling conundrum in which everything he writes becomes reality . Director Gert de Graaff approaches his subject with an impish sense of humor and dazzles the viewer with a series of astounding visual tricks that confront the nature and validity of our perception . Ultimately , de Graaff 's film challenges the audience at several levels to question whether anything we see or touch or taste is really what it appears to be , or whether our entire understanding of the universe and our place in it is merely a trick played on us by our senses .

This movie explores the difficulties that strain hopes , dreams , love and friendship , and incorporates humour beautifully . Along with a stunning cast and brilliant filming , the sound track enhances and amplifies the atmosphere and mood of this work of art . All actors and actresses give an extremely good performance , surpassing expectation in every way . Parminder Nagra is brought on to the big screen for the first time in this film , and she is exceptional , capturing the vividness and vitality that this movie is all about . Keira Knightly also works well with her co-stars , and this is her best work so far . All in all , this is brilliant film , and one that everyone should make the effort to see at least once .
This installment very much makes the CIA look like a very foolish organization . In reality , perhaps they are . After all , the way the plot goes on this it very much looks like one man has the power to sanction killing everyone including his own people in order to kill Jason Bourne . Matt Damon does a very credible job as Bourne trying to stay one step ahead of being killed the entire film . He is still trying to remember who he was & how he has gotten where he is . He gets help from a couple of folks & it seems like every minute of the film , somebody is trying to kill him . There is little time for rest in this film & the action sequences seem very very real . There are a lot of chase sequences filmed with the shaky cam which in a way add to the realism & make it seem less Hollywood than many pictures . These sequences add realism to the film in feeling . The suspense in some of the sequences is brilliantly done as you wonder if someone is going to die or if Bourne can head them off . This is the kind of action suspense you go to see when you want to be entertained & I am sure this one will lead to the next film in the series .
I saw this movie back in 1984 , we first started watching `` This Is Spinal Tap '' and after 5 minutes we were ready to fall asleep . So we went instead to see this movie . If you have any conspiracy theory 's going around in your head , you will want to watch this one . The question you have to ask yourself when watching this movie are : Do you think the government would be capable of doing this ? ( In my opinion there is no doubt that they could ) But I do n't want to give out too much information as that would be a spoiler and I think that you should view the movie for yourself . But , just to let you know , we still talk about this movie 20 years later and trying to explain it to people is not the easiest thing in the world to do .
The Korean War has been dubbed Americas 's forgotten war . So many unanswered questions were buried along with the 50 thousand men who died there . Occasionally , we are treated to a play or movie which deals with that far-off , ghostly frozen graveyard . Here is perhaps one of the finest . It 's called `` Sergeant Ryker. `` The story is of an American soldier named Sgt . Paul Ryker ( Lee Marvin ) who is selected for a top secret mission by his commanding officer . His task is to defect to the North Koreans and offer his services against United Nations forces . So successful is his cover , he proves invaluable to the enemy and given the rank of Major . However , he is thereafter captured by the Americans , put on trial as a traitor and spy . Stating he was ordered to defect , he sadly learns his commanding officer has been killed and has no evidence or proof of his innocence . He is convicted and sentenced to hang . However , his conviction is doubted by Capt . Young ( Bradford Dillman ) , his prosecutor . Convincing commanding Gen. Amos Baily , ( Lloyd Nolan ) of his doubts , he is granted a new trial and if found guilty will be executed . The courtroom drama is top notch as is the cast which includes Peter Graves , Murray Hamilton and Norman Fell as Sgt . Max Winkler . Korea was a far off place but the possibility of convicting a Communist and hanging him hit very close to home in the 1950 's . Due to its superior script and powerful message , this drama has become a courtroom Classic . Excellent viewing and recommended to all . ****
I enjoyed this film . But I was surprised to see people referring to it as a comedy . It was amusing at times , but really , it was n't very funny at all . If I 'd been expecting it to be a comedy , I might have been disappointed with the film , but , going in with no expectations , I found it to be enjoyable and engaging . Maybe it was because , as an engineer , I identified with the protagonist . I was less concerned with satire of capital or labor , and more into the basic story of a man fighting for his invention . A man who 's less interested in monetary gain from his invention than he is in seeing it come to fruition and be put into production . He 's absolutely heroic when he refuses to take the big money and the hot woman in return for suppressing his invention . So I find it interesting that people here have compared it to Jurassic Park ; me , I compare it to The Fountainhead .
Tea Leoni plays Nora Wilde , a serious photographer , who is going through a bad divorce . She wants her freedom but it comes at a cost . She wants to legitimate photography but is hired to work for the tabloids as a paparazzi . Her boss is played by the wonderful and divine Holland Taylor . The show was well-written most of the time . TEa 's Nora was beginning to develop into quite a memorable character but the network just did n't support comedy and they still do n't . Even when they brought in George Wendt from Cheers , they made unnecessary changes in casting and characters . The show was fine in the beginning and the audience was getting used to it but then the network botches it up like a bad plastic surgery .
When I first found out that Brian Krause was going to be in this movie , I wanted to watch . It took me weeks to realize that I 've seen the original of this and loved it . So I had even more reason to watch . Well , I watched . It was actually better than most sequels for TV movies . I hate what happens to Brian 's character ( you can find out for yourself ) and I did n't like most of the characters , Brian 's one included . But the movie needed the cheesy and annoying and jerk-like characters to make Stanley Caldwell ( Judd Nelson ) shine once more . At the end , I was cheering for Stanley and his own happy ending . If you liked the original Cabin by the Lake or if you like horror movies without the blood , I 'd suggest you watch this .
Episode two of season one is a delightful holiday tale of love , betrayal , ... and a homicidal , escaped lunatic dressed as Father Christmas . A woman ( Mary Ellen-Trainor ) has just murdered her hubby on Christmas Eve for his life insurance . What begins as a perfect crime begins a struggle to survive as a deranged , Santa Clause suit wearing psychopath ( Larry Drake , perfectly over the top ) threatens her life ... as well as her precious young daughters . This episode is warmly remembered by even those casually acquainted with the program . By the way , this particular reviewer watches it every Christmas on routine . Most notable for it 's escalating suspense and narrative twists , And All Through The Houst is among Tales From The Crypt 's best .
I borrowed ( slightly modified ) title from some other comment . I have to say , that as i usually do n't like relationship series , I really did liked this one . Great characters , interesting and not cliché story , good acting , good and again not cliché ( which in case of dialogs is rather rare ) dialogs ... It is really interesting , how the characters cross paths with each other , and sometimes knowingly , sometimes more or less at random influence each others lives . But unfortunately , as we say in our country - do you know how do you recognize a good US series ? It is the one that got canceled before the end of the first season . Sure , it is n't always true , but ...
I really do n't understand why people get so upset and pan this movie ! Remember folks , this is an SNL movie , not anything that is supposed to be unpredictable and original in plot or direction ! The Ladies Man is a hilarious movie , albeit stupid at times , with a wacked-out cast and , as usual , WONDERFUL performances by Will Ferrel and Tim Meadows . Yes some of the jokes are stupid , and yes , the characters are unbelievable but its comedy ! I really do n't understand how anyone could n't laugh a lot during this hilarious film . Anyway , all I ask is that people take this as it is -- an SNL , silly and irreverent comedy . Nothing that will win awards , but nonetheless , some modern comedy gold . `` 10-4 Apricot ! ''
Kimi wa petto is a cute story about a girl who one day finds a boy inside a box that is outside her apartment one day . She decides to bring him in and fix his cuts . She then leaves a note for him to eats some food she made then go home because she had to go to work . When she gets home however she finds that he is still there . He tells her that he wants to live there with her like a brother or cousin . In desperation to get him to leave she tells him that if he became her pet then he could stay . And as a pet she says that he would have no rights and do whatever she told him . ( not in that perverted way ! ) To her surprise he agrees and from then on he is known as Momo , her pet .
Being a fan of the first Lion King , I was definitely looking forward to this movie , but I knew there was really no way it could be as good as the original . I know that many Disney fans are wary of the direct-to-video movies , as I have mixed feelings of them as well . While watching The Lion King 1½ , I tried to figure out what my own viewpoint was regarding this movie . Am I going to be so devout about The Lion King that I will nitpick at certain scenes , or am I just going to accept this movie as just another look at The Lion King story ? Most of the time , I found myself embracing the latter . The Lion King 1½ definitely has its cute and funny moments . Timon and Pumbaa stole the show in the first movie and definitely deserved a movie that centered around them . People just love these characters ! My favorite parts of the movie include the montage of Timon & Pumbaa taking care of young Simba and the surprise ending featuring some great cameos . I could have done without many of the bathroom jokes though , like the real reason everyone bowed to baby Simba at the beginning of Lion King 1 . I guess those types of jokes are for the younger set ( which after all is the target audience . I do n't think many kids are really concerned about Disney 's profit margin on direct-to-video movies . ) However , I will say that I was somewhat annoyed when they directly tied in scenes from the original movie to this movie . I 'm just too familiar with the original that those scenes just stuck out like sore thumbs to me . Something would be different with the music or the voices that it would just distract me . As for the music , it was n't too bad , but do n't expect any classics to come from this movie . At least LK2 had the nice ballad , `` Love Will Find a Way . '' As for the voicework , it was well done in this movie . Nathan Lane and Ernie Sabella did a great job as always , and even new cast members , the classic comedic actor Jerry Stiller and Julie Kavner ( best known as Marge Simpson ) , did a great job also . You can even enjoy these great voice talents even more by checking out the Virtual Safari on Disc 2 of the DVD . That feature is definitely a lot of fun ! ! So all in all , The Lion King 1½ is n't a perfect movie , but it 's cute and entertaining . I think many Lion King fans will enjoy it and appreciate it for what it is - a fun , lighthearted look at the Lion King masterpiece from our funny friends ' perspectives . My IMDb Rating : 7/10 . My Yahoo ! Grade : B ( Good )
I found this to be a surprisingly light-handed touch at a 1950 's culture-clash movie . John Wayne would hardly be one 's first choice as a cultural attache , being about as diplomatic with his good intentions as a bull-run in Harrods . But this time he was left to play a part that was far more passive than his usual bluff persona , and he accomplished his task with style . The Duke was a guy who really could act well . His facial expressions and body language could be extremely subtle . Despite his considerable presence both as an actor and in terms of screen time , he failed to dominate this movie . Many of his good intentions came a cropper . He had authority over nobody , and the intermittent narrative was provided by the titular geisha to whom he was the barbarian . The story of American attempts to curry favour with an isolationist Japan was one of political intrigue rather than swashbuckling or hell-for-leather battles . I can not comment on the accuracy of its research but the strangeness of the Oriental culture to western sensibilities was demonstrated well . There was a great deal of minutely-choreographed ceremony entailing what looked to this observer like authentic costume and props . The set pieces were complex and detailed . A lot of money and thought had been applied to it . The fractured romance between Wayne and his geisha added a little extra element , and stopped the movie becoming just a political or flag-waving effort . Script was good without being too wordy . There was a great deal of Japanese dialogue , but the lengthy periods of translation did n't interfere with the narrative . It was nice to see plenty of genuine orientals on the set . Whether or not they were Japanese , I could n't say . But anyway they looked the part . At least the leads were not played by cross-dressing Caucasians , unlike other efforts such as 'Blood Alley ' ( yes , I know they were Chinese ) 'The Inn Of The Sixth Happiness ' or even 'The King And I ' . Frankly , I enjoyed this more than any of those other movies . The script was better for a start . I never liked the songs in 'The King And I ' , and was n't impressed by the heavy-laden anti-communist subtext of 'Blood Alley ' . I confess to never having seen this work before and found it compared very favourably to many of The Duke 's more popular outings . Recommended .
It is so gratifying to see one great piece of art converted into another without distortion or contrivance . I had no guess as to how such an extraordinary piece of literature could be recreated as a film worth seeing . If you loved Bulgakov 's book you would be , understandably , afraid of seeing some misguided interpretation done more for the sake of an art-film project than for actually bringing the story 's deeper meaning to the screen . There are a couple examples of this with the Master and Margarita . As complex and far-fetched as the story is , the movie leaves out nothing . It is as if the filmmaker read Bulgakov 's work the same way an orchestral conductor reads a score -- with not a note missed . Why ca n't we find such talent here in the U.S. ? So now my favorite book and movie have the same title .
One of several musicals about sailors on leave , it is the usual sailor meets girl , complications ensue , sorted out happily kind of plot . It proceeds along smoothly enough but it does drag in places too . The dialogue is not as zippy as 'Top Hat ' for example and Randolph Scott seems out of place . There are compensations . It has some of Irving Berlin 's choicest songs including 'Let Yourself Go ' , 'I 'm Putting all My Eggs in One Basket ' and 'Let 's Face the Music and Dance ' . It has Fred and Ginger who when they are dancing take any film into heavenly heights and they do n't disappoint here . They do a snappy tap dance , a knockabout comic dance and a swirling graceful dance , all in the same film ! Great versatility and artistry . It also has Harriet Hilliard who is rather good in her role . She had a varied career , becoming the more famous Harriet Nelson with Ozzie . Here she is touching without being sentimental.Her two songs are simply and effectively delivered . She makes a good contrast with Ginger but you can believe they are sisters in the film . More tightening up have made the film even better . Pretty good though .
Larry Burrows has the distinct feeling he 's missing out on something . Ever since he missed a crucial baseball shot at school that cost the championship , he 's been convinced his life would have turned out better had he made that shot . Then one night his car breaks down again . Walking into the nearest bar to wait for the tow truck , Larry happens upon barman Mike , who unbeknown to Larry is about to change his life for ever ... ... . The alternate life premise in cinema is hardly a new thing , stretching back to the likes of It 's A Wonderful Life and showing no signs of abating with the quite recent Sandler vehicle that was Click . It 's a genre that has produced very mixed results . Back in 1990 was this James Belushi led production , rarely mentioned when the said topic arises , it appears that it has largely been forgotten . Which is a shame since it oozes charm and is not short in the humour department . We know that we are being led to its ultimate message come the end , but it 's a fun and enjoyable path to be led down . The film also serves notice to what a fine comedy actor James Belushi was . I mean if his style of smart quipping and larking exasperation is n't your thing , ? then chances are you would avoid this film anyway . But for those engaged by the likes of Red Heat , K-9 and Taking Care of Business , well Mr. Destiny is right up your street . Along for the ride are Linda Hamilton , Michael Caine , Jon Lovitz , Hart Bochner , Jay O. Sanders , Rene Russo and Courteney Cox . Mr. Destiny , pure escapist fun with a kicker of a message at its heart . 7/10
As we all know the sub-genre of sex comedies is pretty crowded . Simply being excessively raunchy is n't enough anymore . I 've seen and heard so many disgusting jokes and actions that a sex comedy really needs to have other positive points to appeal to me these days . Coming into the 40 Year Old Virgin I knew basically what to expect ; I did see the commercials after all ; `` is it true that if you do n't use it , you lose it ? '' What I did n't expect to find is a heart and honest attempts at character development . There 's still the weird `` off-the-wall '' characters that we see so much in Adam Sandler movies and there 's still enough inappropriate language to sink Noah 's Ark but somehow the movie has a worthwhile love story and yes even a message . The main character Andy is ( unfortunately for me ) a person I can relate to . In the first shot I see that he even shares my love for Mystery Science Theater 3000 ( he has a poster for the movie on his wall ) and throughout the movie we get to see his really neat collection of antiquities . Andy also has plenty of video games and a working knowledge of films and technology . Andy does n't want to buy a car because he prefers his bike . Most importantly of all ; Andy is a nice person , he does n't swear and he respect women so much that he stays away from them . Combine all these factors and everybody begins to think he 's a serial murderer . It 's like my life story . The other characters each have funny little stories to go along with their slightly exaggerated personalities and they all work on a certain level but not the way Andy does . I felt that it was sort of distracting in a way since Andy and his girlfriend Trish are really the only truly human characters in the entire movie . I suppose since I mentioned one flaw I might as well bring the other noticeable one to light . The story is clever but too predictable and as far as romances go ; it 's quite simple . It deals with Andy 's relationship with Trish for a long time and we all know what 's going to happen in the end . Sure its final detour is a bit different than we may expect but you know what 's going to happen in the end , and I assure you it does . These are definitely small stains on the movie but there 's so much good here that I can easily ignore it 's few faults . When I say `` good '' I mean `` bad '' of course . This is a sex comedy and it wants to be bad . For the most part I think it succeeded . There are so many hilarious scenes such as Andy trying to get rid of an erection after refusing to have sex with Trish . Or the scene where Andy goes with his Trish 's daughter to a sexual education class where he ends up asking more questions than anybody else . Ah and we must not forget the soon to be classic chest waxing sequence `` Ooh ! Como se llama ! '' An interesting little note about that scene ; the actor Steve Carell actually did wax his belly and the pain shown is real . Of course they only did one take but it was still a very brave thing to do on his part . Actually since we 're talking about Steve Carell , I 'd like to say that he has now risen on my list of respected comedians which is sort of odd since I did n't even know who he was prior to seeing this film . I was just so impressed by his writing , acting and timing that I now really want to keep an eye out for his future roles . This man has talent it The 40 Year Old Virgin proves that . To be honest I had doubts about this film but early word was positive and I knew it was something I was eventually going to see . I 'm glad that I did too since it 's probably one of the funniest movies I 've seen in a long time and it doubles as something you feel is worth watching . It 's not simply a series of sex gags lumped together rather it 's a series of sex gags entwined with a very worthwhile character and a truly touching romance . Now excuse me while I go puke my guts out ; I ca n't believe I just wrote that ... My review from Frider Waves : http : //friderwaves.com/index.php ? page=virgin
All Kira Reed fans MUST see this . The film 's premise has struggling romance novelist Kira unable to come up with any new ideas . She 's also getting over a divorce . However , she meets this guy at a restaurant and he helps her out of her shell ( and clothing ) . They go into a corner room and they do it . Thankfully , Kira gets a condom out ( Now do n't ever tell me these Playboy films are worthless piles of soft-core fluff . Remember kids , safe sex ) . Later , she marvels to her publishist how great it was , but she did n't get his name . Despite this , the guy finds her and they continue their kinky games . But eventually she tires of his sneakiness and wants to know more . When she does , all hell breaks loose , and I 'll leave it at that . This is easily the best of these soft-core Playboys films I 've seen . Check this out , and marvel at the greatness of Kira .
`` Bend It Like Beckham '' reminds me of the best of those 80 's teeny-bopper movies directed by John Hughes . Everything takes place in a bubble-gum colored world where everyone is attractive , there are some easily-resolved conflicts that occasionally take away from the mostly happy proceedings , and vast amounts of plot are summarized by montages set to bouncy pop tunes . Nothing wrong with this , however . `` Bend It Like Beckham '' is an absolute treat from beginning to end . My wife and I found ourselves totally won over by the cornball cheesiness even as we were making fun of it , and at the end , as embarrassing as this is to admit , we applauded ( and we saw this , by the way , in our living room , not in a theatre ) . Watch this movie and enjoy . Grade : B+
One of the best movie-dramas I have ever seen . We do a lot of acting in the church and this is one that can be used as a resource that highlights all the good things that actors can do in their work . I highly recommend this one , especially for those who have an interest in acting , as a `` must see . '' There are several scenes of note . For one , the graveyard scene when Hamlet encounters Yorick ( everyone knows about THAT scene by just going to elementary school ) , and his interaction with the skull was extremely well done . The logic used in this scene was tremendous -- I suppose a testament to Shakespeare more than anything else . For a second , I very much enjoyed the scene where Hamlet , Horatio and the character played by Robin Williams discussed the upcoming duel .
Artimisia was on late last night . At first I did n't think I would like it , but seeing I did n't feel like sleeping yet and nothing else being on , I continued watching and felt myself intrigued by the young Artimisia , a virgin , pure and passionate . Her romance with the older Tassi envoked recognisable feelings . Even though the film is based on a very romantisised level and not reality , I loved it a lot more than the usual biographys or costume drama 's . Great play , great camerashots , great music and texts . I loved it and I want more of it ! : - )
Do n't let my constructive criticism stop you from buying and watching this Romy Schneider classic . This movie was shot in a lower budget , probably against the will of Ernest Marishka , so he had to make due.For example england is portrayed as bordering on Germany.BY a will of the wisp Victoria and her mom are taking a vacation to Germany by buggy ride alone.They arrived their too quick . This probably could not be helped but the castle they rented , for the movie , was Austrian . When she 's told that she 's queen she goes to the royal room where the members of the court bow to her , where are the British citizens out side from the castle cheering for their new queen ? Why ISBN't she showing her self up to the balcony to greet her subjects ? Low budget ! Where the audience back then aware of these imperfection ? I wonder how the critics felt ? Durring the inn scene she meets prince Albert but ISBN't excited about it . Durring the meeting in the eating side of the inn your hear music from famous old American civil war songs like `` My old Kentucky home '' , and `` Old black Joe '' . What ? civil war songs in the 1830 's ? Is Romy Schneider being portrayed as Scarlet ? Where 's Mammy ? Is Magna Shnieder playing her too ? Is Adrian Hoven Rhett or Ashley ? What was in Marishka mind ? Well this add to the camp.It 's unintentionally satirizing Queen Victoria'a story . This is the only reason you should collect it or see it 03 11 09 correction Germany and england are connected
I watched this over the Christmas period , I do n't know why but it reminds me of Christmas so I watched it , so there we are . Arthur is a film I watch all the way through with a big dumb smile on my face and its a mixture of special performances , great jolly music and a script crackling with wit and charm that causes it . Dudley Moore makes a character that could well be hated very easily ( spoiled , rich , lazy drunk who feels sorry for himself ) but turns him into someone you love . Liza Minelli is great as Linda Morolla a queens waitress who manages to pull off the tough/soft on the inside lady Arthur nearly gives up his world for . John Gielgud gets all the juicy lines and polishes them off with relish . I can watch Arthur again and again and it always makes me feel good , check it out if you need a lift its a lovely film .
Beautifully filmed , well acted , tightly scripted suspense movie . Had me on the edge of my seat . I liked the lead actress very much , and thought the villain was very well done . Not much to chew on here in the way of a theme , but if you just get in your seat , turn your brain off , watch the fancy camera work , and enjoy the plot , you will have a great time . The plot is well worn , and regular movie goers will probably know more or less what to expect by about ten minutes in . But that did n't bother me , as I enjoyed watching it unfold . In the old days , they might not have focused so tightly on just two characters , and there were some enticing moments when I hoped they were going to let some other people have a few lines . But these folks were probably right to keep the movie so tightly focused . The plot got me by the throat fairly early on , and never let go . It 's not a good idea to think too much either during or after the movie . as I 'm not sure it makes a great deal of sense . Just sit back and enjoy .
Several features of this film immediately date it . The sound is rather shrill and one realizes what great strides have been accomplished in sound reproduction in the ensuing years . The language of the dialogue is rather quaint and unnatural and the acting is still reminiscent of its transition from the stage techniques . Bette Davis always gives a strong performance in all her films as she does in this early period of her very successful career . I do feel however that somehow the cockney accent does not fit the facial expression . I think it is the assumed cockney accent that does not ring true for me . Somerset Maughan loves to delve into human relationships of great dramatic intensity which will please all movie-goers . As in so many of her character roles , Bette Davis can switch from a beautiful seductive woman to a viper full of fiery hatred . Leslie Howard is well cast as the withdrawn English artist with a club foot desperately seeking a partner and making a bad choice in a scheming little waitress . Towards the end of the film the young doctor meets his true love in a busy street . They cross through the traffic completely oblivious to a multitude of horns and whistles screaming at them . This scene is possibly meant to be funny , but i find it quite ridiculous in this otherwise very serious film . It is probably construed to send you home with a smile on your face . And after all as far as we can see ( and hope for ) it is a happy ending .
Originally I rented this film for my daughter since she is keen on soccer - and I was not disappointed that way ( except the plot interfered with the soccer scenes ) . As a dad I suppose I was a little surprised at the introduction of the topic of lesbianism - but I have to admit that as a parent these issues are completely available to children nowadays ( as uncomfortable as I feel with the topic ) . In a way this emotion was a segue right into the main premise of the film - that at some age you must trust your children to make their own choices . This dilemma is introduced by a young British-born teen girl - Jasminder ( Jess ) - of east-Indian heritage who dreams of playing professional soccer . The pending marriage of her older sister in a traditional Hindu marriage provides many rich opportunities for her to explore ( in a nice way ) her hopes and fears for her future . The multi-cultural challenge was a very interesting technique to explore Jess 's frustration with her parents expectations for her - again no different in substance than most child-parent relationships . In SUMMARY , the soccer scenes are GREAT ( lots to learn in slowmo ) and while I did n't need the storyline - something was needed to keep the movie going .
Wonderful romance comedy drama about an Italian widow ( Cher ) who 's planning to marry a man she 's comfortable with ( Danny Aiello ) until she falls for his headstrong , angry brother ( Nicholas Cage ) . The script is sharp with plenty of great lines , the acting is wonderful , the accents ( I 've been told ) are letter perfect and the cinematography is beautiful . New York has never looked so good on the screen . A must-see primarily for Cher and Olympia Dukakis -- they 're both fantastic and richly deserved the Oscars they got . A beautiful , funny film . A must see !
I would just like to say , that no matter how low budget the film is , it needs to be shown throughout this world the point to these movies . We do n't read that much anymore , instead people want to see movies . Having this series out on DVD , has made me want to read the whole series , and want more . PLEASE MAKE ALL 8 MOVIES . Please do n't change any of the characters either , it ruins the effect . Because I have grown to love the actors who have played the characters . PLEASE MAKE ALL 8 MOVIES . I want to see the message , and watch the message that these books and now movies are here to portray . We do n't get that enough anymore . AWESOME JOB ! ! !
Marie : You are smooth . Dan : No , I 'm not smooth . I 'm Dan . If you 're anything like me , smooth and single do not go together . You see someone you like , rare enough as that can be , and you want to say something but you do n't . Or maybe you do say something but it ends up being perhaps the least intelligent thing you 've ever said in your life . More often then not though , you stare from afar and admire without having to deal with taking that which most agree is the only way to get anywhere in life  a risk . You ca n't blame a guy for being a little frightened though . Maybe he 's been burned hard before or maybe he 's trying to focus all his energy on his career . There are reasons , some valid , some not , and all of them can be interpreted as excuses rather than reason . You tell yourself you do n't need it or it is n't the right time for you but you still wish it were happening . Any way you break it down , it 's not easy . Sound familiar ? If you thought yes even just a little , then DAN IN REAL LIFE , the new comedy from director Peter Hedges , is a must-see . It will reach inside of you and somehow manage to both break and warm your heart all at once . The Dan from the title is Dan Burns ( Steve Carell ) , an advice columnist who is admired for his insight into living a balanced , fulfilling and morally uplifting life . Four years or so before the film opens on Dan waking up to his day , he lost his wife and love of his life . After that tragedy , Dan was left to raise their three daughters alone . Between that and focusing on his career , finding love again was not one of Dan 's priorities . And so he became more functional than feeling . Removed from the power of intimacy , Dan no longer knows what it means to be that close to someone and has resigned himself to never knowing that again . That is , until he meets Marie ( Juliette Binoche ) in a book and tackle shop in Connecticut on a quiet morning . They 're interaction is casual , comfortable and it catches both of them off guard . There is only one problem really . She is already seeing someone . Unfortunately for all involved , that someone is Dan 's brother , Mitch ( Dane Cook ) . His entire family has come up to their parents ' country home for their yearly visit and Dan must now spend the weekend pining and yearning for the fleeting feeling he had with Marie that morning . It only lasted an hour or so but it only took that long to awaken Dan 's heart from its coma . With so many family members to deal with ( Jack Mahoney and Dianne Wiest are at the helm ) , DAN IN REAL LIFE does drift away from its grander purpose from time to time . While the cyclone of kids and parents and aunts and uncles makes for trying times for Dan , Hedges also uses it unnecessarily as a means to distract , with the presumption that it would ultimately make for a more complete film . Luckily , Hedges has got Carell to carry the heavy burden . It is a pleasure to watch Steve Carell come into his own more and more with every picture he makes ( despite the occasional EVAN ALMIGHTY-sized misstep ) . He is charismatic , charming and obviously a sharp humorist . As Dan , he is also self-deprecating , awkward and scared . Carell is the rare comedian who pushes himself to find character in his roles rather than rely solely on his comedic instincts and established persona . Perhaps more importantly , he is entirely relatable as Dan . Whether he 's flopping down on the cot in the laundry room where he is subjected to sleep as the only single adult at this reunion or fidgeting around the kitchen , unable to stan d still in his anxiety , Dan is every guy who has even been unsure of himself and felt alone in the crowd . Carell gives Dan so much heart that he becomes the heart of the film itself at the same time . I wondered after seeing the film if I enjoyed the it as much as I did , despite its slight shortcomings ( Juliette Binoche  I know you might like to lighten up every now and then but I do n't recommend it unless there is chocolate involved ) , because of where I am in my life . Would someone who has found that someone else derive as much meaning and comfort from this film ? I ca n't say . What I can say , as someone who knows what it means to be lonely , DAN IN REAL LIFE knows what it means to be surprised by life and love and how these moments and people need to be appreciated and cherished . It also knows that anyone who might be feeling lonely on any given day or for months at a time needs to be reminded that surprises still happen .
tom had a wish to make film for a long time and he did . it is as if he has visualized a dirty and worn out notebook full of great little ideas he has been filling up and carrying around for 10 years . no grant character transformations , no Hollywood ingredients just life and a little bit of magic . the balance , in speed , in weirdness in comedy vs drama is perfectly weighed . this film takes you on a journey that is over before you realize how nice it was . the music is great and your eyes will be equally satisfied . the fact that this film is about nothing , merely a sequence of sketches of people that are mainly linked trough a party of one of the characters , makes it very pleasant and surprisingly entertaining , it is brilliant because it is empty . in between the lines it is happening . to see or not to see , that 's the ?
There are many problems with Mystery Men . First of all there are too many different characters for all of them to be given complex or even interesting personalities . The special effects detract from the story and are not really that special . Paul Reubens is wasted in a pathetic , juvenile role as a character who merely farts and speaks in an inaudible accent . Now onto the decent parts . William H Macy , three heavenly words , and his performance as the shoveler is pitch perfect . The sphinx is an exceptionally funny character who is only mysterious and merely spouts out the traditional mystical proverbs . Ben Stiller is very amusing as well , showing a weak character trying to make it into the big leagues of superheroes . All of the characters do , and that is an area which I found particuarly ironic . That is because all of the actors are Indie film actors trying to make it into the big leagues of Hollywood . To be honest , the reason I thought it failed at the box-office is that America does n't get irony . All in all I loved the film , but I feel it would have worked better if more effort was put into tweaking the script rather than having unneccesary CGI landscapes and effects .
This is mostly a story about the growing relationship between Jeff Webster ( Jimmy Stewart ) and Ronda Castle ( Ruth Roman ) . She takes an instant liking to Jeff in a brief encounter on the deck of the steamer to Skagway , and a longer look when he hides in her cabin while authorities seek him on a charge of murder . They find out they have some things in common besides an animal attraction . Neither trusts a member of the opposite sex , apparently because both have been married to spouses who cheated on them . Gradually , they learn to trust each other , as they journey from Skagway to Dawson . But Ronda clearly has close dealings with corrupt sheriff Gannon and engages in some shady practices in her Castle saloon in Skagway . She eventually has to decide between Gannon and Jeff . Meanwhile , Rene , a young naive French woman also takes an immediate liking to Jeff , but only gets insulting brush offs in return . Yet , she sticks with him in his travels from Skagway to Dawson and his activities around Dawson . Along with Ronda , she nurses him back to health after Jeff is left for dead by Gannon 's gunslingers at his gold claim . Walter Brennan , as Ben , serves as Jeff 's long time sidekick . He does n't have a meaty role , but serves to soften Jeff 's hard edges . His demise symbolically opens the door for a woman companion replacement for Jeff . John McIntire ( as Sheriff Gannon ) makes probably the most charismatic evil town boss you will ever see on film , oozing charm and humor to go along with his bullying . Evidently , he sees something of himself in Jeff , repeatedly declaring that he 's going to like him . He makes a believable incarnation of the infamous Soapy Smith , who spent his last years in Skagway , as one of the premier con men of his times . Jeff is the quintessential antihero , a loner ( except for companion Ben ) , who does n't want to stick his neck out for others , even when he knows he is the one right man for the job . In this respect , he closely resemble 's Burt Lancaster 's character in `` Vera Cruz '' , for example . Thus , Jeff not only turns down the job of marshall of Dawson , he is convinced to leave Dawson after Gannon 's gang move in with clear intentions of taking over everyone 's insufficiently legal gold claims , while disposing of some miners and suggesting that the rest make a hurried exit from Dawson . Even Ronda suggests that she and Jeff make a hurried exit from Dawson while they are still alive . Then , Jeff has a sudden change of heart , apparently still nursing desire for revenge for the shooting of Ben and himself . He changes from anti-hero to hero in leading the expulsion of Gannon 's gang from Dawson . In this respect , he differs from Lancaster 's character , who never reforms ( But is Jeff truly changed , or just handing out revenge for wrongs committed against his own interests ? ) The main problem I see with the plot is the 2 principle women . Clearly , Ronda is groomed as the right woman to tame Jeff . Although she is clearly characterized as a `` bad '' girl , Jeff has a checkered recent past himself , having shot at least 5 men in the US or Yukon , and having stolen his cattle back from Gannon . Ironically , soon after Jeff changes from anti-hero to hero , Rhonda makes a similar change in running into the street to warn Jeff of Gannon 's impending ambush . She dies as a result and Jeff asks her why she did n't just look out for herself ( his supposedly just abandoned creed ! ) . It 's clear that Corine Calvert , as Renee , just does n't make a credible substitute for the dead Ronda , in Jeff 's mind . Yet , the apparent implication of the parting scene is that they get together , even though Jeff never visibly gives her a kiss or hug . Her image as a good , if naive , young woman is somewhat compromised by her job in Rhonda 's saloon of bumping miners weighting their gold dust , pushing the spilled dust on the floor and recovering it later . I 'm also very unclear about her relationship with Rube Morris , a middle aged miner who followers her around and works a claim with her . ( He 's not her father ) . Another problem is the amateurish handling of the gun fight between Jeff and Gannon 's gang . If Gannon had any skill at all with a pistol , he should have killed or seriously wounded Jeff under that boardwalk , before Jeff did the same to him . And how did Jeff 's badly shot up right hand suddenly become well enough to shoot a pistol with apparent ease ? I also wonder what Jeff and friends did to help save the avalanche victims . They were much too far away to pull them out alive from under the snow . And why were n't most of Ronda 's pack horses and mules also buried by the avalanche ? You will see a host of probably nameless but familiar faces among the miners and Gannon 's gang . The sequences shot in the Canadian Rockies provide a breathtaking backdrop to the action . All-in-all , a very entertaining western , with most of the major flaws concentrated at the end . No doubt , this film takes some great liberties with history and geography , especially , the part taking place in the Canadian Yukon , which was in fact much tamer than the US Skagway .
Emily Watson 's Natalia is absolutely the most loving and romantic lead character I have ever seen on a screen . She is the queen of this film beyond all doubt . Or , is she transmuted to the king ? The internecine weaving of the chess games and the families ' struggles for control , power , and victory is stunning . Just as the chess masters in the film do , the director is playing many simultaneous games with our mind at once , but all weave into either major or minor patterns . The period , the costumes , and imagery of early 20th century Italy 's lake district is captured magnificently . Not a single square of space is wasted . So many brilliant scenes abound , I can not recount them all . I recommend budgeting enough time to watch this movie twice , possibly a week apart , because you ca n't possibly capture all the poetry within a 64-square yet multi-dimensional framework in one setting . I did not read Nabakov 's book , but to try an analogy of my own , what I am reading reminds of me of another romantically triumphant poetry-as-game movie , Barry Levinson 's The Natural . It totally jettisoned the downbeat ending of Bernard Malamud 's fatalistic book in favor of a romantic impressionism that was uniquely American . Well , the director did that one better by seamlessly meshing Russian and Italian morals and mores as a backdrop to enlightenment . The true story here is that games are zero-sum ; there is a winner and a loser , unless both contestants draw . But , in life , and especially in the context of our immortal souls , we are only limited by those constraints and life 's conventions to the extent we let others break our spirit . Pure love , as personified by Emily Watson 's Natalia , can transcend and allow all of us to be enhanced by its gifts simultaneously . Only the barriers erected by our fears can cut us off from it . This is a magnificent movie ( 10/10 ) .
What an overlooked 80 's soundtrack . I imagine John Travolta sang some of the songs but in watching the movie it did seem to personify everything that was 80s cheese . Clearly movies that rely on mechanical bulls , bartenders and immature relationships were in style . The best was his lousy Texas accent . Compare that to Friday Night Lights.I suggest watching Cocktail and Stir Crazy to start really getting into the dumbing down of film . Also , as a side note Made in America with Ted Danson and Whoopie Goldberg is an awesomely bad movie . I was so shocked to realize I had never watched it . One more weird movie of this genre would have to include Cadilac Man with Robin Williams . Just remember all of these BIG stars played big roles in these CHEESY movies.. Tom Cruise , Richard Pryor , Robin Williams and John Travolta
I love this movie ! ! ! Purple Rain came out the year I was born and it has had my heart since I can remember . Prince is so tight in this movie . I went to a special showing of Purple Rain last night and it was like a concert i was glad to see some true fans cause this movie is so undervalued , it is really one of the greatest movies of all time . The music is untouchable . The movie is about `` The Kid '' , played by Prince , his family is dysfunctional , his band is the hottest act in town , and he has his eyes on the Apollonia , an aspiring singer . There is no question why purple is my favorite color I can thank `` The Kid '' for that . So if you have not seen this then you are need to asap . This is a classic - 4ever !
This was the second of three films that Irving Berlin wrote for the Astaire-Rogers franchise and it has by far the largest score and is somewhat unusual in that two of the numbers are performed by Harriet Hilliard leaving the rest to be divvied and/or shared between the principals . As usual the storyline need n't detain us though for the record it was based on a play , Shore Leave , that also served as the basis for a Broadway Musical , Hit The Deck . Anyone who actually saw Shore Leave in the theatre may have been momentarily bemused inasmuch as the roles played by Fred and Ginger were created for the movie but what matters , as always , is the music , lyrics and hoofing and this is all out of the right bottle . It 's a departure from the other titles in the franchise in that 1 ) we get to see Astaire play the piano - in real life he was an accomplished pianist and composed several songs , one of which , I 'm Building Up To An Awful Let-Down , had a lyric by Johnny Mercer and spent a couple of weeks in the charts - and it is the only one of the series in which he played a serviceman , albeit an ex-hoofer who enlisted in the navy after being dumped by dancing partner Ginger before the story starts . He gets to perform a little-known but excellent Berlin number , I 'd Rather Lead A Band as well as duetting on I 'm Putting All My Eggs In One Basket but the ultimate number is the prophetic - in 1936 rumbles of World War II were already being felt - Let 's Face The Music And Dance , one of the most potent ballads ever performed by the team . So what if Randolph Scott is a little wooden and fish-out-of-water without either a horse or a six-gun within easy reach and Harriet Hilliard does n't exactly set the screen on fire ; we came to see Fred and Ginger and the only question is , do they deliver . Answer : In spades .
This movie has made me want to become a director , and Michelle Rodriguez is brilliant . How the hell was n't she on mtv 's top 25 under 25 , she beats them all . This film definitely deserved the grand jury prize at sundance , best film i have ever seen .
Michael Cacoyannis has had a relatively long career but has surprisingly few credits to his name , including some real duds such as the unfunny cold war satire The Day the Fish Came Out . Iphigenia , however , is a highlight . Adapted by Cacoyannis from the play by Euripides , it 's a superior rendering of the classic tragedy and recently made its first television appearance in many years in the United States courtesy the Flix Channel . The film is shot on an epic scale but is decidedly not a 'big ' film , with the emphasis placed on the simple story : in supplication to the gods , King Agamemnon ( Kostas Kazakos ) is compelled to sacrifice his daughter Iphigenia ( Tatiana Papamoschou ) , much to the consternation of Queen Clytemnastrae ( Irene Papas ) . Kazakos and Papas are both outstanding , but it is the stunning Papamoschou who brings the most interesting elements to the screen , blending the innocence of childhood with the dawning realization that she is the pawn in a political game . Strongly recommended for fans of international cinema .
This movie is incredible.With great characters , specially the old swordsman that can fly in the shape of fireball and jump across the trees , this film tells a classic story of battle between good and forces of evil.The final showdown is specially breathtaking and the music score is kinda cool . Very , very recommendable.Not for the smallest children though.This one deserves a 10 .
One of the most excellent movies ever produced in Russia and certainly the best one made during the decline of the USSR . Incredibly clever , hilarious and dramatic at the same time . Superb acting . Overall a masterpiece . Score it 10/10 .
Everyday we can watch a great number of film , soap ... on tv . Sometimes a miracle happens . A great film , with real feelings , with great actors , with a great realisator-director . For me there are two films that everyone needs to see : the first is the Pacula ? `` Sophie 's choice '' with Meryl Streep . The second is `` Journey of Hope '' . As human beings , we need to learn about humility , about love of the others , about acceptation of other civilisation , other way of living . We also have to struggle against racism and fascim . We must avoid judging , criticize ; we only have to love our earth companion . This wonderful film , helps us reaching John ( Lennon ) his dream : Imagine all the people living live in peace . These two films are difficult to see : watch these , but sure you will be hurt , but better . Great film , great actors , terrible story , pain and cry guarantee , but also better understanding of the others . Enjoy it .
This will not likely be voted best comedy of the year , a few too many coincidences and plot holes . However we are talking about a movie where a hit-man and a white bread salesman become buddies so a few vagaries should n't come as too much of a surprise . Brosnan is excellent in this role , gone is the wooden James Bond ( a role he was wasted in ) . If he can maintain this kind of quality I hope he continues to make comedies . Greg Kinnear is also excellent as Brosnan 's straight man . I 've read a few negative comments in here about Hope Davis but I thought she was quite good as a mousy housewife with a dark side buried deep within . There are lots of good chuckles as Brosnan sleazes his way through and a few scenes where I nearly died laughing . My father ( a consultant ) nearly lost it when Julian describes himself as a `` facilitator '' . Much like `` Grosse Pointe Blank '' , another hit-man comedy , the humour can be very dark . If you are in to that be prepared to enjoy yourself .
witty . funny . intelligent . awesome . i was flipping channels late one night years ago . came across this and a wildfire started . i was staying up late every night and taping it for everyone i know . a few . like 3 people out of the almost 100 people i made watch this did n't think it was as awesome as i did . the others were laughing out loud so hard they were crying and thanking me at the same time . please do yourself a favor . run do n't walk . watch this and enjoy . intelligence and humor . it 's a win-win situation . i wish i could have afternoon tea with him and meet the truly rare comedian that we as a society need more of ... .sanechaos .
Time for Hollywood to sit up and take notice ! If the actors are acting snooty , all you need to do is get the animators who worked on this little marvel . Renaissance is probably the first animation flick which makes you forget that you are not seeing human beings . Although the voice overs by the cast ( Craig , McCormack , Pryce etc . ) are some of the best i have ever heard but even then the emotions portrayed by the 'cartoons ' are unnerving . This style of animation is not very new but the use of light and shadows makes the movie a living painting . Ironically , such technical wizardry makes you forget that this is actually a very very nice movie . The pacing and plot development are marvelous and the dialogs crisp . Plot : Disappearance of a mega corporation 's top employee unravels a tale of deceit and corruption with a Cold hearted hero at the helm . Ca n't say much without giving it all away ... except that while the movie keeps you at the edge of your seat , the climax leaves you speechless . A must watch..even for the 'grown-ups ' who smirk at 'cartoons '
This is an almost action-less film following Jack , an insomniac , as he goes through hallucinations , is visited by dead friends , throws himself off a building , and , for a lot of the time , ca n't tell reality from hallucination . Dominic Monaghan , as Jack , is truly believable . Confused , and scared but lethargic and , at times blankly accepting of what he sees , we follow him trying to sort out what he 's seeing and find a way to sleep . Introduce a talking dog ( another hallucination ) and children that suddenly appear in Jack 's bathroom and bedroom without any explanation as to how they got there ( more hallucination ) and you have an interesting , mind boggling , 43 minutes And the shower scene is enough to get any Dom fan coming back for more .
Walking home after the film , I was humming the familiar waltz music that Natalia and Alexandre were dancing to . I 've heard that before - where ? Ah , from Kubrick 's `` Eyes Wide Shut '' ( track 2 ) , 'got it just as I arrived at the door . It 's `` Waltz No . 2 from Jazz Suite No . 2 '' composed by Dimitri Shostakovich , performed here by The City of Prague Philharmonic Orchestra . Yes , I went and picked up the soundtrack from Tower 's . What a treat ! The film score by Alexandre Desplat was fulfilling - there are fifteen tracks besides two tracks of the delightful waltz . It 's not often these days we get a soundtrack entirely dedicated to a comprehensive film score . Reminds me of favorite scores by Maurice Jarre , Ennio Morricone ( beginning notes of track 6 have traces of `` Nuovo cinema Paradiso '' ) , Georges Delerue , and John Barry . There are subtle nuances of strains and notes from the strings , celeste , piano , and harp . Emily Watson and John Turturro delivered a credibly consuming paired performance . The love story , their intimate connection , is very much between Alexandre and Natalia - his childlike yet tormenting inner world , and her generous and bold understanding of him - a relationship alone to them both . Director Marleen Gorris of `` Antonia 's Line '' ( 1996 Academy Award 's Best Foreign Language Film from the Netherlands ) gave us a quietly sensitive film - not without its unsettling human conflicts , intrigues , obsessions , family strives , lovingness and respect . The front-end subject is the mind-game and mathematical logic of chess . Beneath it can be a mild tearjerker of a drama set in the late 1920 's . Cinematography captures the serene beauty of Lake Como in northern Italy near the Swiss border . I highly recommend the soundtrack if you do n't feel like going to the movies . Alexandre Desplat 's lyrical film score of `` The Luzhin Defence '' is complete .
Yes , commitment . Let 's say `` Fever Pitch '' might trick you into believing it 's a baseball movie . But no , you do n't have to be a baseball fan to actually enjoy this picture from the Farrelly Brothers . But of course , if you are one , you will enjoy it even more ; with all the references ( pretty accurate ones , I 'd say ) to the Boston Red Sox and its bittersweet history ; from the Curse of the Bambino and everything attributed to it , including those two words you CAN NOT pronounce in front of a Boston fan : Bill Buckner . Drew Barrymore and Jimmy Fallon portray two people who , usually might have second thoughts of going into a relationship : the successful workaholic who is also affluent meeting a school teacher ? Thing is , Fallon 's character wins Barrymore 's heart by being funny , caring , sweet and downright perfect . But her friends ask her a logical question : if he 's such a keeper , why is he still on the market ? Enter the Boston Red Sox . He 's been so committed to his team ever since his uncle passed his Sox season tickets to him ; he has never missed a Red Sox home game at Fenway Park in a long while . And that delicate balance , how much is the workaholic willing to give up for his guy 's obsession ; and how much is that baseball-crazed teacher willing to compromise in order to keep the OTHER love of his life , is what this movie is all about . At first , you might think that the sports-obsession bits of the movie are exaggerated for comic relief . Well , I 'm sad to admit , they are not . Myself , as a die-hard Houston Astros fan , can say they are all true . I would try at every way available to see every 'Stros game ; listen to them on the radio or follow them on the Internet . I read the Chronicle 's sports section every day . And yes , my room looks like The Shed , Minute Maid Park 's gift shop ; with a closet full of Astros gear , including 5 jerseys , 20 t-shirts and you know the rest . Fallon 's character even has the Red Sox MBNA MasterCard . Fallon was credible enough as the fanatical Red Sox faithful , even though he could pull it off without becoming a cartoon ( Thank God Adam Sandler was n't in it ) ; and the plot revolved around how this couple tried to manage with each other 's passions . I 'd say it 'll be a classical romantic comedy . Not enough to be among the best movies in history ; but certainly breaks a mold into the genre and is appealing enough for men and women alike .
What a good film ! Made Men is a great action movie with lots of twists and turns . James Belushi is very good as an ex hood who has stolen 12 million from the boss who has to fend of the gangsters , hillbillies his wife and the local sheriff ( Timothy Dalton ) .you wont be disappointed , jump on board and enjoy the ride . 8 out of 10
I saw this movie on Thursdays night after having a really boring day . I had no expectations , those I had were rather negative . Being that the only movie I 've ever watched Jimmy in is the American version of Taxi with Queen Latifah ( ? ) ... do n't ask why ! But seriously..this movie is so cute ! Drew Barrymore is always sweet , but I almost fell in love with Fallon 's character . Why ca n't I meet a cute nerd like that . : ) Movies like that are excellent . Simple , sweet and necessary . Sunday on a Thursdays . I 'm not even a sports fan , but it 's something about American movies with baseball that fascinates me . Probably the fact that we do n't have that sport here in Norway . ( My first comment ever . ) Haha
The film opens with Bill Coles ( Melvyn Douglas ) telling a story about how his best friend -- make that client -- Jim Blandings ( Cary Grant ) and his family are tightly packed into a small New York apartment , with not enough closet space and way too few bathrooms . When Jim 's wife , Muriel ( Myrna Loy ) , wants to renovate the apartment , advertising exec Jim falls in love with ( or falls for ! ) an ad for a house . Once he 's purchased the house , bills and frustration pile up incessantly as everything that can go wrong with the building of Jim 's 'dream house ' goes wrong . One of three collaborations between Grant and Loy , this is a charming little comedy -- not very taxing , with no real great message , but a great way to spend an hour or two . The laughs are there right from the start , when the alarm clock goes off and Jim tries to shut it off , only to be thwarted at every turn by Muriel . The timing and delivery of the comedic lines and situations can only be given by a couple of seasoned pros , and that 's just what Grant and Loy give us : polished performances , simple chemistry , and a lot of fun . Myrna Loy is in a pretty thankless role ( it 's evident that Grant 's character Jim gets the lion share of the lines and the acting , and Grant , as always , pulls both off with remarkable aplomb ) , but she gives Muriel a colour , life and bite that only Myrna Loy can give a character . Melvyn Douglas plays wry amusement to perfection as well , never hitting a single wrong note . One of my favourite scenes has definitely got to be when Bill gets himself locked in the 'store room ' , and Jim goes to 'save ' him ... only to get everyone trapped inside ! Every little problem that pops up for the Blandings renovation project -- including petty jealousy and an ad campaign for 'Wham ' -- seems to bring together everything that *could* go wrong with building a new house but makes it believable and an enjoyable watch . 8/10
For those that were interested in knowing how exactly humanity came to be encased in big red pods that make me crave pomegranate , there is the duo of the `` Second Renaissance '' shorts . I 'm not exactly sure why they are split into two parts , especially since they 're credited as one on the DVD ( and are these shorts viewed on any other format but the DVD ? ) , but they 're informative even if they have a few gaps . What really makes this first part stand out , from the second part and the rest of the animations as well , is the parallels it shows between robot uprising and civil rights . Graphic homages to slavery , fascism , concentration camps , and mass graves are mixed with verbal references to the Million Man March and humanity 's God-complex . In fact , `` God '' is never really referenced by these shorts , instead replaced by `` Man 's own image '' . As far as the shorts go in the collection , `` The Second Renaissance : Part I '' is by far the most effective in bringing out emotion . It 's a sorrowful and disturbing view of the potential of humanity to become `` the architect of its own destruction . '' Some may be turned off by some of the concepts this short rips directly out of previously established science fiction literature , but then again , that 's basically what most of the Matrix series has done , and it 's been a driving force behind its success . -- PolarisDiB
This film , as low budget as it may be , is one of the best psychological thrillers I 've ever seen . If you accept that it 's low budget from the start , you can appreciate just how good of a story it is , how very well written the script is , and how great the filmmaker was to produce something so wonderful with so little money . All the elements of a great film are here . The visuals , though shot on digital , were gorgeous in places . The bizarre , dreamy feel of the film is captured particularly well in the scene with the talking dog , that scene was just amazing . It 's such a trippy piece of work , but not done in a pretentious way , and because of that I have a whole lot of respect for this film . It comes highly recommended to anyone looking for something unique and captivating , and different from much of the repetitive films that are out there .
Went to see this finnish film and I 've got to say that it is one of the better films I 've seen this year . The intrigue is made up of 5-6 different stories , all taking place the very same day in a small finnish town . The stories come together very nicely in the end , reminding , perhaps , a bit of the way Tarantino 's movies are made . Most of the actors performed very well , which most certainly is needed in realistic dramas of this type . I especially enjoyed the acting by Sanna Hietala , the lead actress , and Juha Kukkonen . I noticed btw that IMDB has got the wrong information about Sanna . Her name , as you might have noticed in my review ; ) , is NOT Heikkilä , but Hietala .
This film is an excellent military movie . It may not be an excellent Hollywood Movie , but that does not matter . Hollywood has a reputation of sacrificing accuracy for good entertainment , but that is not the case with this movie . Other reviewers have found this movie to be too slow for their taste , but  as a retired Soldier  I appreciate the pace the movie crew deliberately took to tell their story as completely as possible given the two hours and nine minutes allotted . The story itself has been told and retold several times over , but it remains for a professional soldier  and an African American at that  to report on the story as presented by the movie crew , and as it presents the US Navy to the world . The story of Brashear 's work to become a Navy Diver , and his life as a Navy Diver beyond his graduation , is not the only story that is presented . There I also the story of how Master Chief Petty Officer Sunday defied the illegal order of his Commanding Officer that Petty Officer 2nd Class Brashear not be passed in his test dive no matter how well he did , and paid the price of a loss of one Stripe and a change of assignment . It also told the true story how Brashear found the third Hydrogen Bombs lost in the Atlantic Ocean off the coast of Spain in the 1950 's , and how he saved the life of another seaman who was in the line of the snapped running line that would have snapped him in two if Brashear had not shoved him out of the way and took the shot himself . This was a complex story that was worth telling , and I will admit that two hours and nine minutes was not enough to tell the full story , and I can tell from the deleted scenes on the DVD that the crew tried their best to tell a story as full as possible . As a professional soldier , I was proud to see such a great story told in such a comprehensive manner , and to see the traditions and honor of the navy preserved in such a natural and full manner .
Things to Come is indeed a classic work of speculative fiction ; both an essay on the destructive nature of war and the terrors of progress . It makes some surprising accurate depictions of the war that was to follow a few years later , but is woefully naive in it 's Utopian ideals . Raymond Massey , Cedric Hardwicke , and Ralph Richardson make up a fine cast , although the drama is played more as a stage piece , than a work of cinema . There are grandiose , if somewhat stilted speeches , often delivered as if the actor is trying to reach the back of the theater . However , there are some profound words there . Is technology the savior of mankind , or the instrument of its destruction ? The film is a visual feast , if one can detach oneself from the age of the effects . Sure , Hollywood is more sophisticated today , but rarely as inventive . For the imaginative , the third act is a treat : a world with underground cities , massive deco bombers , space cannons , gyro copters , and secret organizations of scientist saviors . It has all of the makings of a sci-fi pulp adventure , but instead uses the trappings for a philosophical exercise . Things to Come and Metropolis were the hallmarks of neolithic Hollywood science fiction cinema . They are operatic in scope , and visually inspiring . Technology has long left them behind , but their ideas still burst forth . There is an artistry there , one with more heart and emotion than the computer generated mass-produced cinema of today . These films are the products of artisans , not industrialists .
The basic hook here is : Lincoln Is Slow . It is his slowness that represents his thoughtfulness and deliberation , making him a Great Leader who is here engaged in single-handedly civilizing the American frontier through the grand instrument of Law . All that John Ford hooey and more , including one lurking slave and extraneous Death By Injun . However ! The 'slow ' conceit is also at the center of one brilliant piece of movie-making , funny and moving at extremes . The history may be bunk , but the telling of it suggests a view of history as process that inspires some excitingly true-seeming moments . Check out Henry Fonda 's big introductory stroll across the deck , his shockingly beautiful second visit with his girl by the river , his dalliance with Mary Todd on the porch , and the priceless business that follows 'Ma'am , we 've got to hurry ! ' Things do thin out once we settle into the big courtroom drama ; but Fonda is priceless throughout .
My main problem with the film is that it goes on too long . Other then that , it 's pretty good . Paul Muni plays a poor Chinese farmer who is about to get married through an arranged marriage . Luise Rainer is a servant girl who gets married to Muni . They live with Muni 's father on a farm and they are doing pretty bad . When he finally gets some money to buy some more land , a drought hits and nothing is growing . Everybody stars to head north by Muni stays behind at first . When they leave and arrive at town they find that their are no jobs and they are worse off than before . They even think about selling their youngest daughter as a slave for some money but decide against it . When a bunch of people start looting the town , the military show up and start executing people . Paul Muni does a good job and Luise Rainer won a second oscar for this movie .
First off , I 'd like to make a correction on another review of this film which said that the last musical to win the Best Picture Academy Award was 'Gigi ' in 1958 . That is misinformation as 'West Side Story ' won in 1962 , 'My Fair Lady ' won in 1965 and 'Sound of Music ' won the year after that . That said , this film is absolutely fantastic ! The story from the novel has been somewhat altered , but that 's more because of the limitations that they had on a stage that they just did n't change back for a filmed version . However , I do n't mind . In fact , I rather think the whole production flows better than the novel does . I like Nancy bringing Oliver to the bridge with her and being killed there instead of later in the apartment . The subtle things in this film are the ones that make me laugh . I love the moment Mr. Bumble and Mrs. Bumble start coming out at the beginning from the governors office . The underscore for that moment is brilliant . My three favorite actors for this film were Jack Wild , who plays the best Dodger in any film version of the story , Ron Moody , a playful and humorous Fagin ( this character is worked out much better than he is in the book ) , and Shani Wallis , who is the strongest , most distressed version of Nancy . The only reason I 'm giving this film a 9 instead of a 10 is because of the two big production numbers which are 'Concider Yourself ' and 'Who Will Buy . ' I always hate when the choreography in musicals in meant to look like people doing everyday chores and jobs . It looks awful and cheesy , especially when they 're dancing at the London Meat Co . They should 've just done regular choreography for these scenes . However , this film is a rare treasure that will stay with us , hopefully , forever .
Oh my , from the box description I thought it would be LA-crazy like 2 Days in the Valley or Hugo Pool . Ulrich Seidl must be a very strong man . Most , after directing this , would have driven off a cliff or at least committed a mass murder . I confess to only watching the first half hour ( for now ) . Reading all the comments here , I have a lot to look forward to . Professional reviews often mention the Swedish film Songs from the Second Floor as a parallel but that 's graced with humor and fantasy and this is unrelenting in its dour realism . What hath the Marshall Plan and the EU wrought ? Seeing this in a theater with anyone I know would have only resulted in an enforced departure after many fewer minutes than I got through on DVD . There 's a more annoying creature in the universe than Jar Jar Binks - the Hitchhiker from Hell . Whatever happens to her , it is n't enough ! Soulless suburbia that I thought only existed in Arizona and Florida thrives in Lower Austria . Oh no ! I thought sex clubs had ceased to exist even in New York and San Francisco , and here they are in suburban shopping malls ? Was it Mahatma Gandhi or Jawaharlal Nehru who said when asked about Western Civilization , 'why that might be a nice idea ' ? If the world were truly like this film , bring on that black hole , we 're ready .
Audiences back in 1936 must have been stunned at what they were watching : a full-fledged , beautiful full-length Technicolor film . I ca n't say for sure , but this might have been the first one ( 3-strip ) . At any rate , it still looks beautiful over 70 years later on DVD . In fact , just how good it looks is amazing . Kudos for that have to go out to Director Richard Boleslowski , Director Of Photography Virgil Miller , Selznick International Pictures and , for the DVD - MGM Home Entertainment . All of them combined to give us one of the best-looking films of the classic-era age . I thought the story was so-so : excellent in the first half , stagnant in the second . It gave a nice message in the end , even though a lot of people might not have been happy with it . I ca n't say more without spoiling things . Marlene Dietrich never looked better , I do n't believe , and certainly never played such a soft-hearted character ( `` Domini Enfilden '' ) . Heart-throb Charles Boyer was the male star and Domini 's object of affection , but some of the minor characters were the most interesting to me . People like Joseph Schildkraut as `` Batouch ; '' John Carradine as `` The Sand Diviner ; '' The most memorable , to me at least , was the dancer `` Irena , '' played by Tilly Losch . Wow , there is a face and a dance you wo n't soon forget ! I 've never seen anything like it in the thousands of films I 've viewed . Just seeing her do her thing was worth the price of the DVD . Looking at her IMDb resume , she was only in four movies , but they were all well-known films . Basil Rathbone , the actor who really became famous for playing `` Sherlock Holmes , '' also is in here as is C. Aubrey Smith , another famous British actor of his day . Schildkraut , by the way , will be recognized by classic film buffs as the man who played the arrogant sales clerk in the big hit , `` The Shop Around The Corner , '' with Jimmy Stewart and Margaret Sullivan . The beautiful direction , photography and color , and Tilly 's dance , are the things I 'll remember best about this movie which is a lot of good and not-so-good things all rolled into one . Had the last half hour been better - although I admire the ending - I would have rated it even higher . It 's definitely one film collectors want to add to their collection .
It 's true that you always remember what you were doing at a point when disaster or tragedy strikes . And none more so that September 11 , 2001 , a date which changed the entire global landscape in its fight against terrorism . No , this documentary did n't set out to be dwelling on the events leading to 9/11 . Rather , the filmmakers , brothers Gédéon and Jules Naudet , set out to do a documentary on the trials and tribulations of a rookie New York firefighter . They had gone to the academy and done some shoots of training , and had handpicked their `` proby '' ( probation firefighter ) to join them in an NY firehouse , home to Ladder 1 and Engine 7 . But their production was to develop and contain at that time , believed to be the only shot of the first plane slamming into the World Trace Center . I was traveling back with a friend on the train from a night of LAN gaming , and received a call at about 850pm local time from my Dad , who informed me of the above . Few minutes later , he told me there was another , and that the WTC was under attack . By the time I arrived home , the upper floors of the twin towers were ablaze and in smoke , and to my horror , they collapsed , under an hour . The filmmakers had two cameras running that day , one who had followed a team out on a routine call , and which immediately raced to the WTC upon hearing and seeing the plane crash into it . We follow what is possible the only filmed sequence of events in the lobby of WTC1 where the first responders of firefighters , paramedics , and police had to make sense of what happened , and to quickly develop a plan of action . The other camera , held by the other brother , was making his way to WTC to look for his sibling , and along the journey , captured the many expressions of New Yorkers , as well as the sense of chaos in and around Manhatten . Peppered throughout the documentary are numerous interviews with the men from Ladder 1 and Engine 7 , which miraculously , did not suffer any casualty . But being survivors also brought about its own set of psychological turmoil , as they struggle to come to terms with the event . Through the events that unfold , we learn of the strong camaraderie amongst these men who risk live and limb each day on their jobs , to save lives . We began with what the documentary was supposed to be , before events of the day totally swung in and became the focus , right up to the rescue phase where hopes of finding survivors under the rubble were kept alive by the men who work round the clock in making sense of the collapsed steel structures . It 's not a film that is fabricated , and what you see here can not be recreated in any other documentary ( and heavens , not sound stages for Hollywood blockbusters ) . It 's as close as you can get to that day , witnessing the event up close , from safety . Code 1 DVD contains a separate extra hour of 4 sets of interviews with the men of Ladder 1 and Engine 7 .
Over-powered mobile suits that can annihilate entire armies - Check ! Weapons that hardly need to be aimed and still annihilate everything - Check ! Mobile suits based on angels - Check ! OK - its a Gundam series . This one , Gundam Wing , has good character development , real-world complexity , interesting ideas and some pretty eye-candy . With characters , the initially weak Relena Dorlan ( later Peacecraft , then back to Dorlan ) gets stronger and more independent ( although is still absolutely besotted with Heero Yuy , the series main character ) . The aforementioned Heero , initially a cold , hard butcherer , becomes more and more human , while still remaining in-character . And seeing the lost Millardo Peacecraft ( whos nomm de guerre is Zechs Marquise ) float between OZ , freelance , and command of White Fang shows how some people can really lose themselves in their own creations . The complexity of the political and military situation is also quite good - reflecting how the real world works . However , in 49 half-hour episodes , it does become a bit of a liability in that this complexity is n't used to its full potential . The ideas at the core of the series - the necessity of fighting , the desire for peace , etc - are ones that resonate even today . In retrospect , the series was ahead of its time , what with the `` War on Terrorism '' and all . But its exploration of these ideas , the monologues , especially those of Treize Kushrenada , is an incredible dramatic piece , forming some of the best writing in the series . But that sometimes good writing is also sometimes extremely poor , which dramatically causes it to lose some of its edge . In terms of eye-candy , which is what this one has in bucketloads , everything from the mobile suits to the battleship Libra ( No not the tampons you idiot ! ) is wells designed , and explodes in big balls of orange ( which is bad , because better animation would 've had better explosions ) . But who cares ? ! Stuff explodes , and thats all that matters . In short though , the sheer complexity of the series means that if you miss out on a few episodes , you 've missed out on a lot . The poor writing can leave you cringing , and sometimes the animation makes you go `` WTF ? ! ? ! '' But this is made up for in its classic animation style , its scale , sparks of incredible dialogue , and its more mature exploration that one expects of such Japenese animations .
My comment is limited generally to the first season , 1959-60 . This superb series was one of the first to be televised in color , and it was highly influential in persuading Americans that they had to buy a color television set , which was about $ 800 in 1959 , the equivalent of more than $ 3,000 today . How many of us would pay that much for the privilege of watching a show transmitted by a cathode ray picture tube on a 17-inch screen ? I was eleven when the series began , and I watched it from the beginning . Watching it now , 50 years later , several things come to mind . First , many of the story lines involve the Comstock Lode and the heyday of silver mining , which dates to 1859 . For 1859 , the weapons and clothes are , for the most part , not authentic . ( The haircuts are left out of the discussion . ) That 's basically a nitpick . And , it would have been impossible for Ben to have arrived in the Lake Tahoe area in 1839 and to have amassed a 100-square mile ranch in the next twenty years . Pioneers were still trying to solve the Sierra Nevada problem as late as 1847 , and the Gold Rush did not even begin until two years later . Indians are not played by Native American actors . John Ford was using Native American actors in the 1920s . The Bonanza producers could have easily done so thirty years later . That is a major nitpick for me . There are other time-line problems . In Season 1 , Mark Twain appears , and he is depicted as a middle-aged man . Mark Twain was 24 years-old in 1859 . The stories also vacillate between 1859-1860 ( pre-Civil War ) and what was more suitable for an 1880 time-frame . There are continuity problems , over and over . It is somewhat off-putting , too , that there is so much killing in the first season . In time , the killing was reduced . Many of the episodes take a socially liberal slant , which would be hard to believe , given the time-line , but give the writers credit for anticipating the seismic shifts in the Nation 's attitudes beginning in the 1960s . Having said all that , the acting is good , and I have come to conclude in my latter years that Adam 's character was drawn better than any other 's . I do n't think Pernell Roberts ever got the credit he deserved . Also , Season 1 reinforces the fact that Dan Blocker ( Hoss ) was a good actor . Many of the stories trace real historical events . The guest stars were interesting . This was great family entertainment , and the series stands up very well by any measure .
`` Darius Goes West '' is the touching story of a brave teen coping with Duchenne 's Muscular Dystrophy and his personal quest to see the Pacific Ocean . He receives help and encouragement from a group of young men who love and care for him while going on this quest . The story has a natural drama and honest portrayal of the commitment of young people to help one of their own stricken with this incurable disease . Anyone who thinks young people are self-centered and narcissistic will find this movie to turn that stereotype on its head . It is the power of the young people and their engagement with Darius ' plight that is very compelling in this documentary .
First off , anyone looking for meaningful `` outcome oriented '' cinema that packs some sort of social message with meaningful performances and soul searching dialog spoken by dedicated , emotive , heartfelt thespians , please leave now . You are wasting your time and life is short , go see the new Brangelina Jolie movie , have a good cry , go out & buy a hybrid car or throw away your conflict diamonds if that will make you feel better , and leave us alone . Do n't let the door hit you on the way out either . THE INCREDIBLE MELTING MAN is a grade B minus regional horror epic shot in the wastelands of Oklahoma by a young , TV friendly cast & crew , and concerns itself with an astronaut who is exposed to bizarre radiation effects , wakes up in a hospital , and finds that his body is liquefying on him as he sits there feeling like a chump . The melting man is played by one Alex Rebar , who is recognizable for about the first four minutes of the film . But once he starts oozin ' with Rick Baker 's extraordinary special effects makeup he more resembles something you might find in a tin of spam before you drain off all the runny , viscous blebs of grease . The film has zero exposition and does not bandy about with plot points : There are a couple of scenes involving scientist types riding around on an absurd industrial conveyor machine who dutifully recite a few obligatory lines about the effects of radiation but the movie does not care , really . It 's a freak show and a marvelous one at that with a decidedly sick sense of humor for those who can stomach it -- One great laugh comes when the melting man stumbles upon a young girl in the forest and is so at a loss for what to do that one of his eyes pops out . Hilarious . The `` hero '' of the film is played by Burr DeBenning , a fascinating character actor from the golden 1970s & 80s television scene who was sort of an early model for the Kevin Spacey prototype ; slightly twisted , neurotic , and one step ahead of most everyone in the room even if he looks confused . He appeared just after this movie was made in a bizarre made for TV anthology horror piece called HOUSE OF THE DEAD ( or THE ALIEN ZONE ) that is regarded as one of the finest movies ever made in Oklahoma , which is where I suspect this film was made as well . The arid , cold looking rural midwestern landscapes are certainly the same , and the creek that one unfortunate fly fisher chooses for his afternoon of sport appears to be the same one that Cameron Mitchell fought off flying alien pancakes in WITHOUT WARNING ... which also had a sick sense of humor , a TV friendly cast , and some pretty outrageous gore . I definitely sense at least an aesthetic connection between the three movies , as well as THE SILENCE OF THE LAMBS which is of no surprise considering that director Jonathan Demme is a part of MELTING MAN 's cast . Essentially , as others have pointed out , this is a 1950s B movie plot updated for later 1970s era special effects & the inevitable boobs . The movie it probably borrows most of it 's ideas from is PHANTOM FROM SPACE with Peter Graves as an astronaut who also returns to Earth after being exposed to funky radiation effects that set him off on a killing spree . One of the things that I actually admire about the film is that absolutely no regard is given for the melting man 's motivations : He simply goes on a rampage and the movie 's drama comes from wondering if he 's going to fall to pieces before certain characters fall victim to his madness . The budget for the film is also delightfully low and every dime spent on it is up there on the screen , Rick Baker 's disgusting effects getting the lion 's share of whatever was spent on this . Sick , disgusting fun best enjoyed with a crowd of friends and plenty of beer . Why ca n't people have made more movies like these ? 8/10
This film is a wonderful movie based on the life of a man called Grey Owl in 1930s Canada . I found it to be similarly riveting and heartfelt as 'Rudy ' and 'Awakenings ' . It picks up late in Grey Owl 's life and follows him through his most tumultuous and influential period . The film is about a Canadian Indian trapper who finds himself promoting the plight of the over-trapped Beaver . He also predicts the decrease in natural lands and the overuse of Earth 's resources . This is an outrageous concept in the 1930s and surprisingly well received . He becomes a well known speaker and the masses are ready to listen . The casting of Pierce Brosnan seems rather odd , but is not outrageous . Anyone wanting to argue that point must first watch the movie to understand . Brosnan provides a wonderful performance as does Annie Galipeau . Galipeau is a strong actress whose place beside Brosnan is refreshingly natural compared to the forced pairings in recent Bond films . I would recommend this film to anyone interested in good drama , beautiful scenery , or environmental causes . It is a movie for families as well , however children under 10 ( depending on maturity ) would have trouble following the plot .
I love all of the movies by Michael Landon Jr. And Michael Landon Jr 's casting of Dale Midkiff as `` Clark Davis '' could not of been any better . Dale Midkiff has the ways to pull off this character . This movie kept me spellbound from start to finish . The death of Missie & Willies baby girl with the timing of Clarks visit was only Gods timing . How they dealt with the death and how Clark helped them do so was that of a fathers love . Although there are 3 movies before this one [ Love Comes Softly , Loves Enduring Promise & Loves Long Journey ] , I feel you can see this movie and understand it easily . Yet leave and want to see the previous 3 movies due to the history all the characters have behind them . Michael Landon Jr. is an excellent director I look forward to many more movies from him in the future .
`` The Good Earth '' is a great movie that you do n't hear much about anymore . There are a lot of big disasters and events , but it is also a non-passionate love story . All of this happens in a little over two hours , which is short by today 's standards . The special effects and costumes are very good for the time period . I am surprised that Luise Rainer received an Oscar for such a limiting role . She basically only has three emotions : submissive , hungry , and heart-broken . The performances by the Asian and Asian-American actors are terrific .
This movie is very funny . Amitabh Bachan and Govinda are absolutely hilarious . Acting is good . Comedy is great . They are up to their usual thing . It would be good to see a sequel to this : ) Watch it . Good time-pass movie
Soapdish may go down as one of the single most under-rated movies ever made . A stellar , unselfish cast who understood exactly where the movie was going and the roles they played in it . While everyone hammed it up , there was no one-upmanship . Kline showed wit and great physical comedy , Goldberg and Downey knew how to carry on a funny conversation while someone else was talking , I could just go on . Do not pass this movie by !
I 've always enjoyed films that depict life as it is . Life sometimes has boring patches , no real plot , and not necessarily a happy ending . `` A River Runs Through It '' is the perfect name for this film ( and Norman Maclean 's novel ) . Life ebbs and flows like a river , and it has it 's rough spots , but it is a wonderful trip . Robert Redford brings a lot to the film . His narration has a friendly feel that fits the picture perfectly . As a director , he is restrained and calm , and captures some incredibly beautiful scenes . As for the acting , Craig Sheffer and Brad Pitt work surprising well as brothers . I do n't know quite how to describe Tom Skerritt and Brenda Blethyn 's performances , except that they truly feel real . `` A River Runs Through It '' is a wonderful film . 8.6 out of 10
I saw this movie recently . 2 hours later , my head still hurt from laughing . The plot was soo awful , the jokes were soo bad , but what I did n't count on were : 1. the 2 scenes before and after the movie that had Pat and Jay posing ( that caused more than enough laughter ) 2 . The kick through the windshield that decapitated the evil-doer . This movie is about 20 times better than the Rush Hour series , and my copy even came with a disclamer saying if you did n't like the movie , send certificate to HBO . While I considered it , the date you had to send it in was January 1991 ( which also caused wackiness to ensue ) .
Twelve years ago , production stopped on the slasher flick `` Hot Blooded '' since almost everyone on the set started dying . Now , a couple of film students have decided to finish the film , despite the fact that there 's a rumor that the film is cursed . Well , they 're about to find out that some curses are real . When Scream was released , every country seemed to want to cash in on its success , even Australia . The concept , which today has been done to death ( a slasher film within a slasher film ) was at the time relatively cool and original . This movie was released right before Urban Legends : Final Cut and Scream 3 ( well not in the US but in Australia ) so it felt like the first movie with this concept . When Urban Legends 2 was released , most of us had all ready grown sick of the concept and since the movie was n't even good , the movie flopped disastrously . Now , Cut is not the best slasher flick ever , and nor does it try to be . It knows that it 's a rip-off , and they even cast a girl who looks like a blonde version of Neve Campbell in the starring role . But instead of trying to add some new and original twists to the story , they 've decided to rip-off some 80s slasher flicks like `` Nightmare on Elm Street '' as well and surprisingly enough , this actually works . The killer is very creepy and that mask is just killer ! And instead of trying to scare the audience to death , they 've created a very good and creepy atmosphere which keeps us in suspense through most of the movie . There are a couple of plot holes in the movie though that I was n't able to fully ignore , the ending being the biggest plot hole in the movie . Spoiler ahead ; I mean , they burnt the only copy of the movie so where the hell did they find the print that they show in the final scene ? It makes no sense I tell you . End of spoilers . All in all , Cut is a pretty creepy slasher flick with a silly story but I consider this to be one of the better Scream rip-offs that never made it big . I 'm surprised that this one never got a sequel , but I guess it simply came out too late . Suspenseful Australian slasher flick with very few scares . Cut is still a pretty neat slasher movie and I will have to recommend this one even though I consider the story to be quite silly since it 's completely ludicrous .
The only reason I knew of Midnight Cowboy was because it was in the AFI Critic 's Top 100 . For a top 100 it is not a very well known movie ; indeed , I had to look hard to find a copy , I got the DVD version for about half-price . Surprisingly it was only rated M15+ ( the uncut version ) . I doubt many will take notice of this review ( more like comment ) so I 'll make it brief . This is perhaps one of the strangest movies I 've seen , partly because of the use of montages , artistic filming ( very art-house ) and the unusual theme . There are many things in the film I still do n't understand ( I 've seen it twice ) , and it makes for an emotionally confusing film . The filming and acting were very good , and it is the larger than life characters which make this film memorable . The main character is Joe Buck , a 'cowboy ' from Texas who moves to New York to become a male prostitute . He meets the crippled conman Enrico 'Ratso ' Rizzo and , of course they become friends going through the usual escapades . What makes the film interesting is the two characters are so different . I felt the film did n't really develop the relationship between Buck and Enrico Rizzo for the audience to have any real emotional connection , although the ending is certainly quite sad and tragic . You probably already know what happens by reading the reviews , but its pretty obvious from the start . I personally think the film beautifully and poignantly explores its main themes . The deprivation of humanity ( shown by the darkness of the city streets , the breaking-down tenements ) . Most of the characters in the film exist beyond the law ( a conman , giggolo.etc ) yet you ca n't help liking them . Joe Buck is endearing because he is so naive and optimistic , while we begin to feel pity for Ratso later in the film . I think the film was rated so high because it was certainly very ground-breaking for its period . At the time ( And even now ) it was definitely not a typical movie ( quite art-house ) . At a time when the cinema was dominated by tired westerns , musicals and dramas a film with such an unusual theme as Midnight Cowboy pops up . On a personal level , I must say I quite liked the film . The imagery conveyed a dream-like quality . I particularly liked the scene at the party , the music , images etc stay in your mind for a long time after watching . However , as a movie for entertainment 's sake it was a bit lacking ( not really my style of movie ) in thrills . This is a film to be savoured and appreciated , rather than a cheap thrills action flick . Although I would hardly consider myself qualified to analyse this film , the characters and their motives were quite interesting . From what I understand from the flashbacks , Joe Buck was sexually abused as a child by his grandmother , although it still does n't seem to be relevant to the story . He is a happy-go-lucky young stud , who suppresses his darker memories . The religious connotations in the film are also puzzling . Some have suggested a homosexual connection between Buck and Ratso , although I fail to see where they have got the idea from . The theme of homo-sexuality in general is more than touched upon in their conversation , and later in Joe Buck 's encounter with a lonely old man , but it has little to do with the main story . Certainly from a technical point of view one of the finest films of the decade ( it has more of a 70s feel to it than a 60s feel ) and revolutionary for its time touching on subjects few other films dared to do . While it has a simple , sentimental story to it ( disguised by a hard edge ) the beauty of the film is in the strange , often psychedelic sequences .
Now all the kids and teenagers of Springwood , Ohio are all dead expect for one teenager ( Shon Greenblatt ) is still alive . Freddy ( Robert Englund ) is letting him go and the teenager does n't have much of a memory , when he 's arriving in a new town . When a tough female psychologist ( Lisa Zane ) tries to break though the new patient . She 's finds out , where he 's from . She brings him along to Springwood to spark some memories but three teens ( Lezlie Deane , Breckin Meyer and Ricky Dean Logan ) , who unexpected came for the ride . Once they arrived in Springwood , the psychologist has some memory that she did lived in that town before as a child . While Freddy knows the true secret of her true identity . Directed by Rachel Talalay ( Ghost in the Machine , Tank Girl ) made a grim but somewhat oddly different sequel with some visual style and funny moments for this horror/fantasy/thriller . Yaphet Kotto ( Alien ) has a supporting role as a Psychologist expert on dreams . This has some ingenious visual effects ( Not everyone will love the climax , especially in 3-D ) and some good style in its storytelling . This one did out gross some of the film 's series at the box office . DVD has an strong anamorphic widescreen ( 1.85:1 ) transfer ( also in Pan & Scan ) and an strong-Dolby Digital 5.1 Surround Sound . DVD has the original theatrical trailer , Jump to a Nightmare opinion and Cast & Crew information . The `` Elm Street '' Series Box Set , the eighth disc has interviews with the the cast & crew of this sixth film . The sixth film is also in 3-D for the film climax but you could watch it at 2-D also . This is the last of the `` Elm Street '' films until Wes Craven resurrected Freddy into a different , darker style in `` New Nightmare '' and the silly but surprisingly enjoyable spin-off horror film `` Freddy Vs Jason '' . Watch for Robert Shaye ( Co-Owner and Co-CEO of `` New Line Cinema '' ) , Roseanne Barr , Tom Arnold , Johnny Depp and Alice Cooper in amusing cameos . Written by Michael De Luca ( John Carpenter 's In the Mouth of Madness ) . From a story by the director . ( *** ½/***** ) .
When I saw this animation for first time ( I was 15 maybe ) I was really impressed ! It has completely different style compared to the japan animation and i kinda like it more . Tho whole impression of the movie is more sinister and dark ... The colors are not that ... colorous . The Characters do n't talk much , there are no long and boring conversations of this and that ( like in Ghost in the Shell ) .With its dark pictures , views of strange beasts and sense of magic , it looks like one of those ancient Scandinavian stories , full of violence and horrendous creators , enchanted forests and deep caves , dwelled by dragons , throlls , orks ... and one mysterious hero to stop evil ...
An utterly beautiful film , one of a handful of I saw when young that entranced me then and still do , in Thief 's case the impression actually seems to get better with the passing of time . By the '90 's my daughter and I had seen it many times on TV but still went to the pictures when it came to the local art-house cinema  when it had finished we came out starry eyed with heads full of poetry and Miklos Rozsa 's stirring music wishing it could have lasted a couple of hours longer and thinking what a beautiful world it suddenly was again . Idealistic Prince Ahmad wants to slum it amongst his people for a while to check things out , but evil Vizier Jaffar takes his chance to imprison him and seize the throne . After escaping with a little thief played by Sabu , Ahmad spots a Princess and they fall blindingly in love  along the way they have many adventures ( although apparently not enough for Sabu ! ) and Love not only conquers but annihilates everything . The special effects must have been mesmerising in 1940 , but Time has taken its toll and lessened their impact especially since digital cartoonery has taken over even live action  but they still hold up well compared against films like Superman from 40 years later . Anyway , if I 'm requested to suspend disbelief in gargantuan guffawing genies , flying horses and carpets I also suspend disbelief in perfect special effects ! Favourite bits : the dreamy scene in the sunlit garden when Ahmad reveals himself and Adelaide Hall 's suitably romantic song ; the stunning colours in the tent in the Land Of Legend  in fact , the stunning colours throughout ; Sabu and Rozsa 's triumphant but still wistful finale . Conrad Veidt played the baddie in two of the most incredible movie romances ever , this and Casablanca , and then died . John Justin and June Duprez were great in the leading roles of lovers , both of them slightly and refreshingly stilted , but the parts did n't call for a huge range of emotions : only pure love mattered . There 's a couple of mildly violent images in it , but rest assured this is a glorious feelgood experience with a 100 % positive message , it 's only a pity that nowadays little kids do n't watch this instead of the porn they prefer . One of my Top 10 film favourites , I ca n't recommend this too much  may it be shown to the end of Time .
mature intelligent and highly charged melodrama unbelivebly filmed in China in 1948. wei wei 's stunning performance as the catylast in a love triangle is simply stunning if you have the oppurunity to see this magnificent film take it
'I only wanted to see you laughing in the Purple Rain . ' This is an excell film . It should have been re-rated to PG-13 . But anyways , Prince 's first film and greatest . The follow-up sucked . But I have n't seen for years so here 's what I can remember about it . The Kid ( Prince ) has to juggle with winning over the love of his life , Apollonia ( herself ) , keeping his band together ( The Revolution as themselves ) and the tension in his family . But his rival band ( The Time as themselves ) is ruining his life . Like Morris ( himself ) is trying to steal Apollonia from The Kid . Just like Saturday Night Fever , Flashdance and 8 Mile . Really good . Rent it , laugh and cry and if you luv it , buy it .
Very good except for the ending which was a huge disappointment . The script was very good as was the acting . The visuals were often very grainy but this in a way added to the film as the snowy features were in good places that helped create a mood towards the film . This affect was ruined by the extremely unbelievable ending . I was going to give this film an 8 out of ten but the ending knocked it down a point to 7 because it seemed to depart radically from the first 75 minutes of the movie and seemed quite forced at the end to make the film makers look clever . This movie though was much better than films with quite a lot larger budgets and seemed to be filmed like a home movie with some extra equipment . Not much in the way of special effects as these go but for suspense it was very good .
It is not an easy film to watch - it is over three and a half hours long and it is composed entirely of conversations . Yet it is so incredibly compelling and ruthlessly observational of the human character , that it is , in my humble opinion , one of the very greatest films of all time . The film is depressing , cynical and cruel . ( If you want something uplifting , see Jacques Rivette 's fantastic Céline and Julie Go Boating , which was made around the same time ) . It shows the idealism of the late 1960s to be nothing different from the society that it was trying to change . It involves a supposedly liberated ménage-à-trois between Alexandre ( played by Jean-Pierre Leaud ) , Marie ( Bernadette Lafont ) and Veronika ( Francoise Lebrun ) . Yet Alexandre is shown to be as chauvinistic and jealous as any other man . The women are exposed as being willingly subservient and defining their femininity through the male gaze . The film is an extremely icy end to the highly revolutionary French New Wave . This movement was one of the most significant movements in film history and had a profound effect on cinema as we know it . Jean-Pierre Leaud was one of the key actors of the New Wave , having starred ( among other films ) in the influential Les Quatres Cent Coups ( 1959 ) by Francois Truffaut as a rebellious teenager . Director Jean Eustache is not as well known as other directors from the New Wave , but he should be . There is no improvisation ( unlike in John Cassavetes 's similar films made in the US ) and the dialogue comes from real-life conversations . The film is resonant with Eustache 's personal experiences . For example , Francoise Lebrun was a former lover of Eustache . Eustache himself committed suicide in 1981 and the real-life person that the character Marie was based on , did too . The anger and bitterness all culminate in a harrowing monologue by Veronika delivered directly to the audience , breaking down the coldly objective nature of the rest of the film . This mesmerising , personal , and honest filmic statement remains one of the most revealing films of human nature around .
The 40 Year Old Virgin , is about Andy Stitzer , a forty year old man who works in an electronic store and does n't have much of a social life and is very awkward around women . Some of his co-workers at the store invite him out one night and they discover that Andy , is still a virgin so they plan to help him lose his virginity . One day in the store Andy , meets a woman named Trish , who gives him her phone number and eventually Andy , works up enough courage to go on a date with her and they start to really like each other but Andy , is still very awkward when it comes to sex and he is going to have to tell this to Trish , much to his embarrassment if he can actually get up enough courage to tell her before things get awkward . The 40 Year Old Virgin , has good direction , a good script , good comedic performances by the whole cast , good cinematography and good film editing . The film stars and is co-written by Steve Carell , who does a very good comedic breakthrough performance and his writing for the film is very good too . I was very pleasantly surprised with this film . It is sweet , funny , entertaining , fun , enjoyable , clever , good natured and a good time . This film is just as good as this year 's Wedding Crashers , and both films are two of the best comedies I have seen in awhile . The 40 Year Old Virgin , really showcases a lot of talent and it is put to good use and it works as a comedy and a romance and it is sweet and a lot of fun . One of the biggest surprises and one of the best comedies of the year .
A surprise thriller with more twists and double crosses than a doodle pad . A great cast mixing it up with an intriguing plot overseen by a Twin Peaks-ish influence in director Dahl . Nicholas Cage is a very underrated actor and shows a great portrayal of a man in a bind looking for the right thing to do . J.T . Walsh ( RIP to a great actor ) is always a wonderful villain , as is Dennis Hopper . It 's such a shame he never made to a higher profile in the biz . I 'm sure he has his followers , though . In all , this is a great film that shows you that you do n't need big bangs or a commercial soundtrack to be an entertaining film .
I bought this a year or more ago for $ 2 ( yep , $ 2 ) , left it on the shelf for ages , now watching DVDs while holed up with a cold . This is a haunting movie . Brilliant performances by all involved , especially the 6yo boy ( about the only smiles you get in this movie ) . Plot reminds me of perhaps my favourite movie ever , Grosse Pointe Blank , but obviously that 's lighthearted , this is heavy hearted . As a psychologist , a clinical and forensic psychologist , a shiver went up my spine when the identity of the new contract was revealed . Scary stuff ! Brilliant work all round . Pete
I find Alan Jacobs review very accurate concerning the movie ; however I had the opportunity to rent the DVD from blockbuster with a commentary from BYU 's Curator , Motion Picture Archives James D'Arc . The then LDS Prophet Heber J . Grant approved of the movie understanding the deviations from historic content for dramatic expression and telescoping events . For example the movie showed Joseph Smith on trial . despite Brigham Young 's great oratory in defense of Joseph Smith he was convicted anyway . Then Joseph was killed . Historically Joseph Smith was never convicted of anything . Brigham Young was in Boston when Joseph Smith was arrested for this particular trial . Joseph Smith and his brother Hyrum where both killed before the trial took place .
Clever , gritty , witty , fast-paced , sexy , extravagant , sleazy , erotic , heartfelt and corny , Footlight Parade is a first-class entertainment , what the movies are all about . The realistic , satirical treatment gives a fresh edge to the material and its pace and line delivery are breathtaking . To think that they only started making feature talking pictures 7 years before this ! The brilliance of the dialogue can not be matched anywhere today , especially considering that `` realism '' has taken over and engulfed contemporary cinema . This film was made at a time when the Hayes code restricting content was being ignored and the result is a fresh , self-referential , critical and living cinema that spoke directly to contemporary audiences suffering through the depression and the general angst of the age . I 'd recommend watching any film from this period , that is 1930-1935 , for a vision of what popular cinema can potentially be .
I was literally preparing to hate this movie , so believe me when I say this film is worth seeing . Overall , the story and gags are contrived , but the film has the charm and finesse to pull them off . That gag where Jason Lee thinks he has crabs , and tries not to let his boss/future father-in-law and co-workers see him scratching himself is n't terribly intelligent , but it sent me into a frenzy of laughter . Very few of the film 's gags are high-brow , but they made me laugh . As I said , the film has charm and charm can go a long way . The characters are likable , too . I must say I wish I got to see more of James Brolin 's character , since he was a hoot in the very few scenes he was in . Plus , I admire any romantic comedy that has the guts to not make the character of the wife ( who serves as the obstacle in the plot ) a total witch . The Selma Blair character is hardly unlikable , and there 's never a scene where I thought to myself , `` Why did he want to marry her in the first place ? '' The ending is Hollywood-ish , but it could 've been much more schmaltzy . The cast is talented . I have n't had a favorable view of most of Jason Lee 's mainstream work . I just loved him so much in Kevin Smith 's films that I could n't help but feel disappointed at seeing him in these dopey roles . And he never looks comfortable in these dopey roles . Even in this movie , he does n't look perfectly comfortable , but he contributes his own two cents and effectively handles each scene . But I still miss his work in independent films . Julia Stiles proves again why she 's so damn likable . Of course , she 's a very beautiful girl with a radiant smile that makes me want to faint , but she also possesses a unique charm and seems to have good personality . In other words , her beauty shows inside and out . I do n't know the actresses ' name , but the woman who plays the drunk granny is hilarious . Julie Hagerty also has a small part , and she 's always enjoyable to watch , which makes me wish she received better roles . I loved her so much in `` Airplane '' and `` Lost in America '' that it 's a shame she does n't get the same opportunities to flaunt her skills . Do n't be put off by the horrible trailers and even more horrible box office records . This is a funny , charming film . Romantic comedies are getting so predictable nowadays that it feels like the genre itself is ready to be flushed down the toilet , so it 's always to see a good one among all these bad apples . My score : 7 ( out of 10 )
In what will probably find itself on my list of Fuller 's best movies ( that is , once I see more of them that just this and Shock Corridor ) , Pickup on South Street is a film noir where the femme fatale , as well as the male protagonist , are not the stereotypical ones in the genre . Like most of his other works , Fuller injects his own experiences and the sense of New York style that is usually absent in the Hollywood noirs . On a small budget- at least for the likes of Darryl F. Zanuck- Fuller and his actors create personas that are likable even in such a dark atmosphere . The good guys are basically the ones who wo n't get violent with you even as they 're looking for an extra buck . Richard Widmark , Jean Peters , and Thelma Ritter are all terrific in the lead parts . Widmark is one only a few actors I can think of who could 've really pulled off this character . He 's a little like Bugs Bunny , as he can be a wise-ass who is a little sneaky . On the other hand , the character of Skip McCoy does have a set of values in his life . He does n't go into other people 's affairs , and does n't try and care about much of the working world outside of his little shack on the river , after being sent away for three years . He slips up , unbeknownst to him , when he pickpockets a woman ( Peters ) on the train , and lifts an item that 's under the eye of the Government . It may have some secrets that could make him a lot of money . But at what cost is the centerpiece of the film , as it involves stoolie Moe ( Ritter is one of the finest , and most believable , character actors from the period ) , the woman 's ex ( a volatile Kiley ) , and the police department . Aside from the thematic elements , which are told with a keen dramatic , journalistic style ( as was Fuller 's previous position , along with boxer ) , the dialog is fresh and involving . There 's a spontaneity in many of Fuller 's camera moves . And what a third act . This is a lean , tight film-noir that is worth checking out even if you 're not familiar with Fuller ( it 's comparatively less bizarre than some of his later works ) .
Great actors , an oscar nominee actress , stunning scenery , good strong story line and more laughs than you can fit into my new handbag ( and thats quite big ) . This film was brilliant . It was beautifully acted in the more serious scenes and the funny moments were . .well , side splitting . I have never heard a cinema audience laugh so much , and tears were streaming down my cheeks during the 'stoned ladies in the tea shop ' scene . Well done to the British film industry and to Craig Ferguson whose magic ingredients have made sure this is one of my favourite films of the year , if not of all time .
Of course I would have to give this film 10 out of 10 as my uncle was the main screenplay writer of Once upon a Crime . Rodolfo Sonego wrote screenplays for over 50 years living in Italy . He was a great story teller and someone suggested that he put his stories into writing . So Rodolfo Sonego did . If you check out his biography , you can see the number of movies that have been made in Italy . Alberto Sordie was the main actor that starred in his stories . My uncle visited Australia and my town , in 1968 to check out locations for `` A girl in Australia '' and created a great movie about a proxy bride after the second world war . You can see his humor in all his movies . I found a copy of this movie on DVD recently . GREAT
I can remember watching this for the first time , when I was 9 years old . I wanted to be one of the `` barbarian brothers '' . This movie is still great . One original aspect was that the fight scenes where very short . Implying that the `` barbarian brothers '' where so good that they finished there enemies off quickly ! Plus , you have chases , a cage fight , a dragon , and yes even a bar brawl ! Yes , the acting is bad so that 's why it 's not a ten , also the story line has received a lot of criticism . I think it is quite original . Not to many movies in it 's genre have the same original story lines , or colorful dialogue . I definitely recommend this film .
Guys and Dolls is a unique play based on the characters . Sky Masterson ( Marlon Brando ) is a high-class gambler who takes up a bet with Nathan Detroit ( Frank Sinatra ) for one-thousand dollars . Nathan needs the money so he can run his usual crap game and make a fortune . The bet was that Sky would n't be able to take just any girl to Havana , Cuba and the `` doll '' he chose was Sarah Brown ( Jean Simmons ) who was in charge of a missionary . Sky finally bribes Sarah enough to go to Havana with him . They end up falling in love with each other , but later she accuses him of something he had no part in . Nathan ran a crap game in the missionary the night they were gone . Nathan 's 14 year fiancé Adelaide ( Vivian Blaine ) disapproves of Nathan 's gambling and tries to stop him from doing it . However , when the movie ends it all ends happy with a double wedding . The songs in this movie are just wonderful no matter who sings it . Marlon Brando has no singing voice at all and true they could have dubbed him but it did n't really matter . He did a wonderful acting job ( obviously seeing as it 's Brando ) and played his character very well . I have seen a few movies with Jean Simmons and thought that this movie was her weakest one , she also could n't sing at all . However , the singing is made up by Frank Sinatra , Vivien Blaine , and Stubby Kaye . Vivien Blaine and Stubby Kaye was also in the original Broadway production of Guys and Dolls . Vivien Blaine had a terrific voice and was the perfect Adelaide . If you like musical , and even if you do n't , i advise you to watch this .
I loved the movie , but like everyone said , there were some bits that were n't developed enough . I thought personally that the girls were very vapid before they landed in prison ; sure , they were supposed to be innocent American girls but still ... I felt like they lacked that bond that best friends are supposed to have . For example , in the montage where they 're sight-seeing , the way they held each other for the photograph was very awkward-looking . Then , there are some parts that were very ambiguous . I think it 's pretty much understood that Danes ' character did n't do it , but I can see how that could be confusing . Also , why did the camera dwell on Manat bearing a very grim expression after he put the bags in their taxi trunk ? I thought it was suggesting something , but it turned out to be nothing . Apart from that , the movie was great . I cried when Claire Danes took the blame ; she 's a GREAT actress . Also , I wanted to see that bitchy Thai inmate get her ass kicked . Talk about lack of closure ...
Though the pieces are uneven this collection of 11 short films is truly a moving and human experience . There were some who , in the wake of the emotion on the anniversary of the bombings , took this to be anti-American . I do n't think thats the case , even though some parts might be taken that way if you do n't look behind the obvious . Ultimately the film is nothing except an attempt by people to express their confusion , sympathy and feelings about what happened . These are stories of people who 's worlds have been shaken up by what happened on a Tuesday in September . As I said this film will move you , probably to tears . Its not always easy to watch , for example the film from Mexico is little more than a black screen with sound , but its effect is such as to lay even the strongest of people low . If you can be strong you really should see this film . It will comfort you and enlighten you and affect you ...
One of the best documentaries released in recent years . Some points ... 1 . Hugo Chavez was elected Venezuela 's president in 1998 , his support largely coming from the poorer regions of Venezuela . 2 . In 2002 , a coup briefly deposed Chavez . At the time , Irish filmmakers Kim Bartley and Donnacha O'Briain were in Caracas , shooting a documentary about Chavez for British television . Their film deconstructs the coup and its aftermath , and electrifyingly records history unfolding on-the-spot , outside and inside the presidential palace . 3 . Chavez aimed to free Venezuela from the free-market policies imposed on it by the US . Though Venezuela 's oil was already state-owned , it was run for private benefit by executives who Chavez wished to replace . 4 . Despite being the world 's fourth largest oil supplier , Venezuela remains swamped by poverty , its resources literally sucked away by foreign multinational corporations . 5 . The documentary begins by portraying Chavez 's first years as president before the coup . It focuses on his popularity with the poor , and his various policies which proved popular with working class locals ( educational plans , distribution of the oil revenue , grass-root democracy etc ) . 6 . Chavez was a huge proponent of education , and printed thousands of copies of the Venezuelan constitution , encouraging children and adults to study and understand it . 7 . When Chavez came to power , he immediately pledged to redistribute oil profits . This , understandably , made the oil companies nervous . 8 . A media-war broke out . The six private TV stations promptly began opposing the state-run TV station . They questioned Chavez 's motives , sanity and sexual orientation . 9 . Without media support , the coup would not have been successful . The film makes it clear that coups rely heavily on the media to disseminate information and that news can be easily fabricated . 10 . Under the guise of `` re-establishing democracy '' , the opposition silenced the state-run TV station , dissolved the National Electoral Board , Supreme Court , National Assembly and took control of the military . 11 . Moneyed interests , backed by the military elite ( encouraged by the US and CIA ) , organised a citizens ' march on the presidential palace to effect the coup . Snipers shot at Chávez supporters , but the private media stations edited footage so it appeared that return fire was aimed at the opposition march that in fact had been safely diverted . 12 . Police went on a shooting rampage against Chavez supporters , further bloodying the streets . 13 . Chavez , held captive , refused to resign . Of course the media/government then lied , saying he had resigned , but Chavez 's cabinet members communicated the truth to the international community , which eventually got the message back to Venezuela by cable TV . 14 . The people rose up , pressuring the return of the president they had elected , whom only a referendum could constitutionally replace . 8.9/10 - At a little over an hour long , this doc is far too short . Nevertheless , its an engrossing piece of journalism and deals with a form of `` media warfare '' which rarely gets touched upon . Makes a great companion piece to `` The Battle of Algiers '' . Worth one viewing .
I very much enjoyed `` The Revolution Will Not Be Televised '' . It gave me , once again , a positive feeling about the power of people to decide for themselves how they wish to be governed . It is unfortunate that in Venezuela the twenty percent of wealthy citizens have made all of the decisions for the eighty percent of the poor for decades , if not centuries . However , when their coup failed ; after the interim government dissolved the Supreme Court , and The Constitution , and the Ombudsman , and the Electoral Boards , and all Civil Rights , no one took the plotters out behind a barn somewhere and shot them . They have n't even gone to jail . The major plotters are living in Florida , carrying on . And the protection that they had was the `` Bolivarian Constitution '' passed by a large majority of the Venezuelan People . It is not only History that Bites . Democracy can give you one hell of a nip if you let it loose . And in Venezuela it is loose .
Firstly , I have heard great things about this film , not least among the retro/vintage scene and the stockings lovers who absolutely love Bettie Page and it did not disappoint . Shot in very clean black and white with colour added for key scenes , the film gives a documentary feel to the early life and career of Bettie Page . There are many things I did not know about Page . Firstly , there was the gang rape , later on , there is her early attempts at developing an acting career and then glamour pictures , firstly with a camera club peopled with men who ca n't get enough of her and later with the Klaws , Paula and Irving , who despite their taking of bondage and fetish photos , come across as extremely pleasant and friendly people . If only modern pornography producers were like that , perhaps better porn would be a consequence ! For the most part , the film is neither a diatribe against the evils of pornography but an attempt to show the kind of environment that existed in the 1950s for those producing fetish and nude pictures of women . This environment was extremely repressive , perhaps in a good way because it meant that there was none of the 'saturation ' effect that we have today , when it comes to pornography . It also appeared to be much less harsh . Page comes across as someone who enjoys her work and does n't appear to be degraded by it . In many of her photos she is seen tied up and gagged ( and trying to hold a conversation ) , brandishing a whip with a flourish , thus exciting the photographers taking her pictures and seen in 'initiation style ' girlie bondage movies which look quite tame compared with the hardcore stuff we have now . Page never became an actress and instead deserted pinup when she was in her thirties for 'Jesus Christ ' . Her belief in God and Jesus never goes away , even when bound and gagged she still insists that she has been given a 'gift ' by God to do 'this thing ' . Seeing this film , I am more knowledgeable about Page and in awe at her modesty , beliefs and demeanour . She is one of a kind , compared with the identi-kit clone blondes we have today and someone who can actually say 'There is life after porn ' .
I think 'Blackadder the Third ' is the best one of the series . Actuelly all the episodes are funny , personally i really like the episode with the 'French invasion ' , but the one with the superstitious actors , in 'MACBETH ' is also really funny , the way Rowan keeps playing on with them is really ( English ) Humor at the highest level . Actors : 'Never say that again , always call it the Scottish Play ; Blackadder : Oh , So you want me to say the Scottish Play ? Actors : YES Blackadder : Rather than MACBETH ... ! I am a big fan of Rowan and i have the majority of his work , but i think he did the series of Blackadder especially good . I Hope Rowan is going to continue his great style , but i think we can count on him , because he is already working on a Bean 2 Movie , that will be out this year , i ca n't wait ... I Give this 3rd Blackadder a 9 out of 10 Rating .
This is my FAVORITE ALL time movie . It used to be my Friday night movie with a pizza and bottle of wine when I was single . I first saw this movie with my aunt Brend and sister Chasity . I was in the 2nd grade . I fell in LOVE with Travolta and Sissy was my new best friend . I 've read a lot of comments about why Bud left Sissy & how Sissy has to `` learn to act '' married . But let 's go back and look at this for a second : SPOILER - My interpretation of the movie now , not when I was eight is this about Bud & Sissy 's relationship takes a turn for the worst because she makes a fool of him at Gilley 's riding the bull . They get in a huge fight . Bud tries to make Sissy jealous by asking Pam to dance . Sissy then thinks two wrongs will make a right and Wes asks her if `` she needs any help '' . They 're all on the dance floor acting like fools when Bud asks Pam , `` when are you going to take me home and rape me ? '' Pam answers : `` When ever you 're ready Cowboy '' . Bud then goes home with Pam to her condo in downtown Houston . Which Daddy has bought for her with his oil money and `` all that that implies '' . Bud is the one who cheats on Sissy . Sissy is waiting for Bud when he returns home the next day . Sissy is the ONE who leaves Bud . Then , it 's up to Bud to prove to Sissy that he is a real `` cowboy '' and win her back . Anyways , that 's my interpretation . Everyone has their I 'm sure ! I love this movie . And believe it or not , I got myself a REAL cowboy ! I love him too ! : )
As others have mentioned , all the women that go nude in this film are mostly absolutely gorgeous . The plot very ably shows the hypocrisy of the female libido . When men are around they want to be pursued , but when no `` men '' are around , they become the pursuers of a 14 year old boy . And the boy becomes a man really fast ( we should all be so lucky at this age ! ) . He then gets up the courage to pursue his true love .
I saw this movie when it came out when I was 17 years old and into classic rock ( still am ) ... I never liked opera before because I hate soprano voices , but he changed all that . He was adorable in the movie and had such an amazing voice . I heard on CNN that he died tonight at home of pancreatic cancer , he will be missed , and he definitely left his mark on this world . I hope to buy this movie if I can find it , watch and enjoy . *smile* Maybe I should head over to Amazon.com and have a look before it 's sold out .
By some happy coincidence the same year that Jimmy Stewart and Kim Novak made Alfred Hitchcock 's haunting masterpiece `` Vertigo '' , they also made this light comedy . Perhaps the two actors needed to do it after undergoing the heaviness of the Hitchcock film . At any rate this a great companion piece to `` Vertigo '' as it again explores a very un-likely but powerful romance . In fact the film can be seen as the flip side of `` Vertigo '' with it 's happy ending . Here again Novak undergoes a transformation , in Vertigo she essentially plays two women and here she 'transforms ' from witch to mortal . Stewart is again bewitched and for awhile tormented by his love for her . Unlike Vertigo the two come together in `` Bell Book and Candle '' , a perfect antidote for the Hitcock movie . Again the dynamics of love and attraction are examined but in an altogether different vein . The cast is terrific . Lemmon hilarious as Novak 's warlock brother and Elsa Lancaster giving a classic performance as the Aunt . Ernie Kovacs as the alcoholic cult writer and of course Hermoine Gingold playing Novak 's competitor are all great . The scene with Stewart drinking the potion is comedy at it 's best . Anyone who has seen Vertigo or even if you have n't should see this memorable light comedy .
This film illustrates the worst part of surviving war , the memories . For many soldiers , men and women alike , returning home can be the beginning of real problems . I am reminded of my father and his brothers returning from WWII . For one of my uncles the war was never over . He survived the D-Day invasion , something akin to the first 20 minutes of Saving Private Ryan . For him the memories not only lingered but tortured him . He became an alcoholic as did several of my cousins , his sons . Jump ahead 60 years and place the soldiers in a different war , in a different country , the result is the same . When I saw this at the KC FilmFest , I was reminded that there are somethings about war that never change . The idealistic young men and women are not spared the emotional torment of what happened in Iraq , and especially if you are against the war you will come away with more compassion for the soldiers there trying to do what they believe or have been told is right . The tag line from the Vietnam war film Platoon says it all . `` The First Casualty of War is Innocence . ''
'Had Ned Kelly been born later he probably would have won a Victoria Cross at Gallipolli ' . such was Ned 's Bravery . In Australia and especially country Victoria the name Ned Kelly can be said and immediately recognised . In Greta he is still a Hero , the life Blood of the Town of Jerilderie depends on the tourism he created , but in Mansfield they still have n't forgotten that the three policeman that he 'murdered ' were from there . Many of the buildings he visited in his life are still standing . From the Old Melbourne Gaol where he was hanged , to the Post office he held up in Jerilderie . A cell he was once held in in Greta is on display in Benella and the site of Ann Jones ' Hotel , the station and even the logs where he was captured in Glenrowan can be visited . Evidence of all the events in the movie ( except for his love interest ) can be found all over Victoria , in police records and even in the Sash that Ned was awarded with for rescuing Dick Shelton from drowning . None of this is wrong , and whats left out would further justify Neds actions . The Horse that Ned 'stole ' was actually stolen by Wild Wright ( the man who Ned boxes with after getting out of jail ) . Ned was already in prison when the horse was reported stolen so he could n't have stolen it . The Jerilderie Letter is more than what has been stated before . It is not self justification it is Ned 's biography , an outline of what he stood for and who he was protecting . So go ahead and read it , watch the movie and then make up your mind about what Ned stood for .
This film is one of the best of all time , certainly in the horror genre . The claustrophobic atmosphere is outstanding , the music is just as good as the film and the killer is as creepy as can be ! Actors are fantastic , RIP Donald Pleasance you were fantastic as Dr Loomis , he made the film even better . Without him the film would be missing a vital ingredient . Jamie Lee Curtis is also superb as our beloved scream queen ! Her innocence makes her unaware of the real evil that is after her until she finds her friends grossly murdered in the house , which of course is one of the films best scenes . She gives a tremendous performance . I loved this film since it scared me like hell back when I seen it in the very early 80 's and I still watch it to this day as it is a marvellous movie that just brings you in to this world were you could be gutted like a fish at every turn ! The fact that it is a simple format of a mad man in a mask whom has escaped from a mental asylum and ready to kill everyone in sight without them having any idea that he is there , is just shockingly terrifying and indulges you even more into the movie as the events though fiction could easily be come true . We all know that unfortunately evil does exist in this world and a mad man with a knife is certainly not uncommon , a very disturbing an deep fear for all of this . Death at any turn . Halloween of course shows this in it 's most terrifying way . Horror should be believable , and that is what makes the film enjoyable . It 's just a simple story that is made into an excellent and terrifying atmosphere . As well as Psycho 's superb storyline , both of which I adore , I believe there formats are the best horror has to offer . To me Halloween and Psycho are the best films I have ever seen and I will watch them all my life and never grow tired of them . Halloween is undoubtedly one of the best movies of all time .
I saw this Australian film about 10 years ago and have never forgotten it . The movie shows the horror of war in a way that Hollywood usually glosses over . The relationship between the soldiers of the two warring countries is highlighted by the differences in culture and the ultimate knowledge that in the end we are all really not different on the inside . If you can find any type of copy of this -- buy or rent it . You wo n't be disappointed , just awed .
hi for all the people who have seen this wonderful movie im sure thet you would have liked it as much as i. i love the songs once you have seen the show you can sing along as though you are part of the show singing and dancing . dancing and singing . the song ONE is an all time fave musical song too and the strutters at the end with the mirror its so oh you have to watch this one
It is not known whether Marilyn Monroe ever met and spoke with Albert Einstein ( and since the mysterious disappearance of her diary after her equally mysterious death , we may never know ) , but in their lifetime the opportunity was there . Scripted by Terry Johnson from his own play , Nicolas Roeg 's Insignificance imagines an encounter in a New York hotel room one night in 1953 between the two icons plus Joe DiMaggio ( Busey ) , and Senator Joseph McCarthy ( Curtis ) - but only on one level . On another level , it elevates - or reduces - these 'personalities ' ( and what a lousy phrase that is ) to mere avatars ( the characters are deliberately unnamed ) , at once greater and lesser in status . The title Insignificance is both apposite and deeply ironic ; here , DiMaggio 's net worth has been reduced to little more than a picture on a bubblegum card . Monroe too is reduced to her constituent parts of dress , hair , lipstick , wiggle and voice . By uncovering their insecurities and reversing their roles , the film brings into sharp focus received notions of celebrity , exploding the cult of personality . Furthering the theme , there will be another explosion at the film 's climax : Hiroshima in a hotel suite , in which 'The Actress ' is burned to a cinder in seconds ; a literal deconstruction of fame . Goodbye , Norma Jean . History informs the script , which in turn , shakes history upside down . As Roeg mused after watching Johnson 's play for the first time , `` These characters were mythic , not invented by any single person , not the public or the press , probably not even by the characters themselves . '' As played by Theresa Russell , Marilyn ( a closet intellectual in real life ) , lectures a childlike Einstein ( 'The Professor ' , played by Emil ) on the theory of relativity using balloons and a flashlight , while getting The Professor to show off his legs , in conscious parody of her own role in The Seven-Year Itch , the movie The Actress is seen to be working on in the film 's opening . History records that Monroe 's then-husband , fading baseball star DiMaggio ( played by Busey as a tenderly psychotic simpleton ) , was unhappy about her iconic dress-splaying scene in the film , precipitating their break-up . Right on cue , we discover the jealous 'Ballplayer ' in a bar , bemoaning the fact that if , `` I want to see her underwear , I just walk down to the corner like all the other guys '' . In contrast to The Professor , The Ballplayer believes the universe is round - a contention shared by Native Americans . But the Big Chief ( Sampson , of One Flew Over The Cuckoo 's Nest fame ) who operates the Roosevelt Hotel 's elevator has been all but disenfranchised from his own culture : `` I no longer Cherokee - I watch TV . '' Meanwhile , 'The Senator ' is investigating The Professor , who is on the eve of delivering a pacifist speech to the United Nations , but whom The Senator suspects is a Red . In fact , as he divulges to Monroe , Einstein is wracked with guilt over Hiroshima , and what the white heat future holds . Yet in a seemingly godless universe , all such worries and aspirations are rendered insignificant in the light of a higher ( atomic ) power . Roeg really is the perfect director to bring Johnson 's stage play to the screen . Throughout , tortured childhood flashbacks and pessimistic flash-forwards ( ka-boom ! ) draw unexpected connections between time , place and circumstance , with the repeated visual motif of a wristwatch employed to mark time 's passing - but perhaps also to suggest all time is one time ; each moment co-existing . As evinced by his back catalogue , it 's something of a hobbyhorse for a director enchanted with the notion of synchronicity - see Do n't Look Now in particular . Here , 1920 bleeds into 1945 and drip-feeds into the 1980s , a period in which another 'Actor ' has taken on his greatest role as the President of the United States . If all this sounds rather heavy going ( quantum physics is surely involved ) , the execution is anything but , owing to Johnson 's witty , zippy screenplay , Roeg 's playful direction , opening out an essentially stagey set-up - and the cast themselves , who are on stellar form . Tony Curtis especially leaves denture marks in the wood panelling as the paranoid , impotent Senator , who is seen attempting congress with a Monroe impersonator ( a real one , as opposed to Russell 's ) , before being let down by his dwindling member . Of course , Curtis once co-starred with the real Marilyn Monroe in Some Like It Hot , and whose embrace he memorably described as like `` kissing Hitler '' . As Roeg commented , `` Everything suddenly seemed connected ... when the film began to take shape even the actors themselves seemed part of this endless linking . '' It all goes into the pot , to be boiled down and served up in new and fascinating ways .
I liked Top Gun . It held my interest . Predictable plot , decent character development and story line . It is pretty similar to High Noon in that the town people appear weak and scared to stand up to a villain . This movie has some quality actors who really did not get a chance to share all of their talents . Also some of the actors did not receive credit for their roles . Denver Pyle was a good looking man in his younger days . John Dehner , Rod Taylor are outstanding in their roles . Sterling Hayden did the best that he could with poor material . It is hard to imagine him as a gunslinger . Laura , played by Karen Booth , was a nauseating character . She seemed flattered that two men may have been fighting over her . Ugh . Finally , How can people travel without luggage ? Especially women .
Still the definitive program about the Second World War , The World At War is n't just long , but also very informative . The series contains 26 episodes ( each episode lasts for about 45 min . ) , and includes the events leading up to and following in the wake of the war . Most episodes are about the war in Europe , and there are several episodes about the war in the Pacific . Other episodes include information about the wars in Africa , Burma , the Atlantic and the home fronts of Germany , Great Britain , United States and Soviet Union . There is one episode that 's dedicated to the Holocaust . The series starts off with the episode A New Germany ( 1933-1939 ) , and tells about the rise of the Nazis in Germany and German territorial gains prior to the outbreak of war . The series ends with the episode Remember ; the war 's influence in a post-war world . Remember is a fitting episode to end this great program . Every episode begins with a short introduction and then with opening credits . The credits are accompanied by a powerful music theme . There are many fitting music pieces throughout the series . Each episode is like a mini-film . The footage is fantastic , and so is the way it was put together . In addition , some of the footage is in color . The information included also makes the episodes memorable and entertaining . The series was produced by Jeremy Isaacs for Thames Television ( UK ) . Commissioned in 1969 , it took four years to produce , such was the depth of its research . The series was narrated by Laurence Olivier ( one of the most famous and revered actors of the 20th century ) . The series interviewed leading members of the Allied and Axis campaigns , including eyewitness accounts by civilians , enlisted men , officers and politicians , amongst them Albert Speer , Karl Donitz , Jimmy Stewart , Bill Mauldin , Curtis LeMay , Lord Mountbatten , Alger Hiss , Toshikazu Kase , Arthur Harris , Charles Sweeney , Paul Tibbets , Traudl Junge and historian Stephen Ambrose . Jeremy Isaacs says in `` The Making of The World at War '' that he sought to interview , not necessarily the surviving big names , but their aides and assistants . The most difficult subject to locate and persuade to be interviewed , according to Isaacs , was Heinrich Himmler 's adjutant , Karl Wolff . The latter admitted to witnessing a large-scale execution in Himmler 's presence . The World At War is often considered to be the definitive television history of the Second World War . Some consider it the finest example of the documentary form . In a list of the 100 Greatest British Television Programmes drawn up by the British Film Institute in 2000 , voted for by industry professionals , The World at War ranked 19th . The program has everything that the viewer needs to know about the war . After watching a few episodes I liked the series so much that I tried to watch the remaining episodes one after the other . I 've seen some of them several times . There are two other great documentary series that I know of that may be of interest to the viewer . One is called The Great War ( 1964 ) that 's about World War I . The other is called Cold War ( 1998 ) that 's about the Cold War obviously .
What happens when someone has so much social anxiety that they cease to function ? How alone can one man get ? When the mundane crap we have to do in order to be part of society gets to be too much , what happens ? Frownland explores these questions . Definitely a startling original debut from Bronstein . The tone is strange and claustrophobic as we get inside the mind of a guy named Keith that is so messed up he can hardly form a proper sentence . We follow him around as he tries to make contact with people and function day to day . Most of us have known people like this- people that say `` sorry '' too much or `` i appreciate it '' when there 's nothing to appreciate . So we know there are people out there like this but why would someone want to make a movie about them ? Well , because its interesting and Bronstein and the lead actor , Dore Mann , do an excellent job . This film is about as un-commercial as a film can get . A few friends filmed it over the course of a few years as they saved money . It was shot on 16mm and the scratched film look is beautifully low budget . With no distributer , this may be a tough one to find , I think it 's been screening randomly for the past year or so . Hopefully it 'll be on DVD at some point . I saw it at the Silent Movie Theater here in LA . There were 10 people in the audience , among them Crispin Glover , if that tells you anything about how weird this movie is . Highly recommended .
In terms of visual beauty this movie is outstanding ! I had no idea that Technicolor came out so early . Although I did n't like the ending , the entire movie is fantastic and makes me wish that I was in North Africa . The cast is excellent and Marlene Dietrich is a big plus and of course she is so alluring and I just loved her in this flick . Basil Rathbone is also perfect in this movie . I could n't get over the scenery and the sets ... The hotel , the palm trees , the desert , it 's all there ... the legionnaires also bring a `` Beau Geste '' feeling to the film . They certainly do n't make movies like these anymore . Do n't fail to watch this classic !
On paper this looked like a great concept : Average guy on the rebound dates up tight bookish museum curator , who is really a hot Superhero who saves the world on a regular basis . However , director Ivan Reitman and writer Don Payne ( of the `` Simpson 's '' ) almost fatally miscalculate in having their hero G-Girl ( played by striking Uma Thurman ) come off as a total nut job as both Superhero and secret identity persona Jenny Johnson . The movie even cops to this in a conversation between Jenny and Matt Saunders ( Luke Wilson ) following his rescue by G-Girl from the Statue of Liberty . Jenny curiously asks Matt what was G-Girl like . Matt replies , `` She 's kind of nutty `` I think the intent was to have Jenny ( Thurman ) be this lonely young woman , who has no one in her life , isolated by her great physical powers . Thurman does the best she can , but her Jenny is a terrifying mood swing in dire need of Prozac . Luke Wilson is way too breezy in the role reversal of boyfriend and superhero girl friend . `` My Super Ex-Girlfriend '' is also a victim of bad timing , coming on the tail end of `` Superman Returns '' which plays Superhero straight up , so to speak . With all its quirks and inconsistent writing I still thought `` My Super Ex-Girlfriend '' was funny and enjoyed the movie . Given that this is an Ivan Reitman movie , this could have been a lot better . Reitman starts with a great premise , and really squanders it . First off , we all love the hero . Here neither Jenny nor G-Girl is really all that likable . This is surprising for Uma Thurman , who is normally a charismatic and powerful presence . In the beginning her Jenny/ G-Girl is just plain weird . Shocking . Because if there is a woman who can play a Superhero , she is Thurmanshe looks great . Only toward the end does her Jenny become more sympathetic , instead of caricature . Although `` My Super Ex '' is not a straight Superhero story , rather a romantic comedy of sorts , it does not provide what every Superhero mythology requiresa great super villain . Here we have Professor Bedlam aka Barry ( Eddie Izzard ) who really is evil lite . He is no Lex Luthor . No plans for Global domination . Bedlam rather Barry does hold a grudge against G-Girl , and expectedly it has to do with their shared past . What is bizarre you do n't know who you would rather spend time withBedlam or G-Girl ? Luke Wilson 's Matt is just `` some dude '' who happens to hook up with the psycho superhero . One of the annoying things he does is that he confides in his repugnant loser friend Vaughn ( Rainn Wilson doing a bad whacked out impersonation ) . Wilson sometimes plays it a little too dense , and this dilutes his likable charm . This does however work , in the comic sex scene with Jenny . Matt while dating Jenny/ G-Girl realizes that he is in love with his co-worker Hannah ( perky Anna Faris ) . So how does Matt break up with G-Girl ? Well , it 's not pretty and for the most part hilarious . Dramatic Superhero movies work . Romantic comedies with chemistry work . What may be inherently difficult are Superhero satires disguised as romantic comedies . Everyone loves the hero . However , hero nut job ? Maybe not . With all Uma Thurman 's talent she is unable to accomplish this convincingly . And she does not get sufficient support from Reitman and Payne . Thurman and Wilson have enough charm and presence to survive their narrative failings . `` My Super Ex-Girlfriend '' is fun and funny . Though given all involved , the movie could have been super .
It tries to be the epic adventure of the century . And with a cast like Shô Kasugi , Christopher Lee and John-Rhys Davies it really is the perfect B-adventure of all time . It 's actually is a pretty fun , swashbuckling adventure that , even with it 's flaws , captures your interest . It must have felt as the biggest movie ever for the people who made it . Even if it 's made in the 90s , it does n't have a modern feel . It more has the same feeling that a old Errol Flynn movie had . Big adventure movie are again the big thing in Hollywood but I 'm afraid that the feeling in them will never be the same as these old movies had . This on the other hand , just has the real feeling . You just ca n't hate it . I think it 's an okay adventure movie . And I really love the soundtrack . Damn , I want the theme song .
Of all the breakdancing / hip-hop films released between 1983 and 1986 , the 1984 film Beat Street is unquestionably the best one . The story follows a DJ , his younger breakdancing brother , a graffiti artist and a wanna-be showbiz promoter through one winter in which they try to break out of the ghetto using their `` street '' talent . The acting is n't always up to par and the characters are n't fully drawn out , but they are more than compensated for by down-to-earth dialogue , a plausible story , fantastic dancing sequences and a timeless hip-hop sound track . It should be noted this film was shot in the birthplace of breakdancing ( `` This ai n't New York , this is the Bronx ! `` ) , and features appearances by the fathers of breakdancing , dance troupe Rock Steady Crew and rapper Afrika Bambaata . Rock Steady Crew provide the best scene in the film when they dominate a dance battle at the premiere breakdancing club of the early 80 's , the Roxy . A must see for hip-hop lovers .
Bette Midler is indescribable in this concert . She gives her all every time she is on stage . Whether we are laughing at her jokes and antics or dabbing our eyes at the strains of one of her tremendous ballads , Bette Midler moves her audience . If you ca n't see it live ( which is the best way to see Bette ) then this is the next best thing . An interesting thing to look at is how incredible her voice has changed and matured over the years but never lost its power . Her more `` vocally correct '' version of `` Stay With Me '' never loses anything in spirit from THE ROSE or DIVINE MADNESS , Here it is just more pure and as heartfelt as ever . I will treasure this concert for a very long time .
Harvey Keital 's best performance so far the new century . Very nicely photographed , a beautiful snap-shot of pre-Castro Cuba . The story revolves around the nephew of a local minor crime boss who develops a friendship with an American with Hollywood connections . It 's really about the moment when a boy awakens to the fact that the small circle of people he knows actually live in a much larger , much more complex world that he does n't yet understand.the script is strong and filled with humor , the direction is crisp . Over all , a really professional job that fits in well with the tradition of Latin American cinema . The one weakness is the decision to shoot in sync-sound English rather than Spanish - probably to improve sales in the US . Unfortunately , this just makes the film a little less convincing . But if you can see beyond this , you will find a heartfelt trip to another world . Recommended .
I generally love these 1930 mystery/police Charlie Chan type of movies , and this is no exception . However , something seems bad with this movie . A late attempt to switch from cerebral Moto movies centered around the plot contrivances to a salad bar spoilt by comedy relief that is as relieving as sore feet . A typecast buffoon appears from nowhere impersonating a clumsy Englishman who plays the detective , and even other characters seem entangled into providing comedy relief . The plot may seem odd or a bare excuse to us today , but back then the possibility of epochal archaeological discoveries was not only real , but a commonplace occurrence .
`` GEORGE LOPEZ , '' in my opinion , is an absolute ABC classic ! I have n't seen every episode , but I still enjoy it . There are many episodes that I enjoyed . One of them was where Amy ( Sandra Bullock ) walked into a moving piece of machinery . If you want to know why , you 'll have to have seen it for yourself . Before I wrap this up , I 'd like to say that everyone always gave a good performance , the production design was spectacular , the costumes were well-designed , and the writing was always very strong . In conclusion , even though new episodes can currently be seen , I strongly recommend you catch it just in case it goes off the air for good .
I watched the trailer on the DVD after seeing the film , and I think anyone who saw it before watching the film would be very surprised and possibly disappointed . It made much of the fact that the film was `` by the director of Cube '' and made it look like a horror film , when in fact it is an Absurdist comedy ( IMDB 's spell checker does n't seem to think that Absurdist is a word , but it is ) , reminiscent of Rosencrantz and Guildernstern are Dead . I love the way the story builds up slowly at first , then gradually escalates . I also enjoy the fact that no explanation is given for what happens in the film . That and the fact that the story plays out mainly in just the one set are the only respects in which this film is similar to Cube . I recommend it .
Saving Grace is a feel good movie with it 's heart in the right place . Grace is recently widowed and realizes her late husband left her with a lot of debts . She could lose her lovely house and sees no other solution to her misery than to start growing marijuana . She 's living in a beautiful village where most viewers would love to live and the villagers are all wonderful people most viewers would love to have as neighbors . There 's only one thing wrong with this picture and that is the way it portraits the effect marijuana has on it 's user . It 's obvious none of the actors or writers of this film actually ever did smoke the stuff . The way the villagers act after smoking a joint is ridiculous and only supposedly funny . It 's precisely in those scenes that wit is replaced by English slapstick , and that is a pity in a movie that is none the less very enjoyable .
Finally , the uncut version of `` Baby Face '' surfaces and from what source ? The Library of Congress . The restored four minutes , snippets here and there , make for a much better film . We now know that Baby Face was pimped by her old man from the time she was at least fourteen years of age . Another reason d'tat for her behavior and cold , calculating exterior . Barbara Stanwyck is indeed amazing in the role of Lily Powers ( notice the moniker ) , a part that called for just the right amount of sexuality coated with power , cunning , and revenge , yet tinged with virginal pretense when called for , a very difficult portrayal to make convincing . Barbara Stanwyck conveys the necessary nuances to show that though she sleeps her way to the top ( literally ) , she still has good in her heart -- note the way she treats those few who have been kind to her such as Chico ( the marvelous actress Theresa Harris ) and the old philosopher . And though she exploits her sexuality to make mush of men who are rich and powerful , those same men are attempting to exploit her for their carnal desires with no intention of permanent ties until they fall in love with her . Lily Powers fails to understand , at first , that emotions are difficult to ride , that it 's easy to lose control . One possible result is death . Hitching a wagon to a star of course materialism can take one to a destination where nothing else exists but the ephemeral , and it 's a cold lonely location . A word should be said about the philosophy of Friedrich Nietzsche whose will to power is stressed in `` Baby Face '' by the elderly philosopher who befriends Lilly when she is still turning tricks for her old man . `` Baby Face '' was released the same year Adolf Hitler came to power in Germany . Though it 's highly unlikely that the semi-literate Hitler understood much about Nietzsche , he considered himself a Nietzschean to the nth degree and touted it along side his other rantings . `` Baby Face '' serves as an indictment of the popular interpretation of Nietzsche 's will to power concept , especially in the final scenes . Although `` You 've got the cutest little baby face . '' is apropos as a theme for `` Baby Face , '' an even more telling and applicable melody is W. C. Handy 's `` St. Louis Blues '' played throughout the film , especially at times when the camera has to drift away from what would otherwise be sexually explicit scenes . `` St. Louis Blues '' is also used wisely toward the end as Lily begins to see beyond materialism to eternal values . Chico is singing a raw , salacious version of `` St. Louis Blues '' when Lily , now disagreeing with the lyrics , orders her to stop . The restored version of `` Baby Face '' makes the film more modern in its approach and attitude toward sex as power than many a new Hollywood release . By all means watch this gem from the distant past and enjoy .
I loved this movie ! ! ! The characters were people that you could feel for . The young man back from the service still in love with the girl he left behind . Tom Drake is always perfect in the romantic lead as well as Donna Reed as the love of his life . The looks he gives her as if he has been starved for the sight of her as well as her hesitation and confusion as too her feelings for him were played very well . The rest of the quirky characters at the store were perfect as they tried to bring them together . The most touching scene however , was the young couple at his great grandfather 's house . I laughed in parts , cried in some and thoroughly enjoyed watching this movie . In fact I 've re-watched it about 5 times . A definite must see for total romantics .
Jörg Buttgereit goes a bit too far with his movies and themes at times , even for my taste but his movies are always something special and hard to classify . They are artistically made , with also often deeper meaning to its themes . This movie is a perfect example of his work . It 's also really hard to label this movie . It 's not really a movie with a story to it , in a sense of having a beginning , middle and end in it . It also does n't have a main character but instead focuses on 7 different suicides and killings , on 7 different days . All different stories are being told with lots of class , though some of them are of course more 'interesting ' and realistic than the others . They are not necessarily connected but yet together they still tell a story . The movie does n't feel disjointed at all . All different stories have a different feel to it and Buttgereit tells the story without hardly using any words ( also typical for his style ) but instead lets the images and obvious sensible emotions of the characters tell the entire story . It helps to make this movie an effective one to watch . Again , the production values all are n't too high and this might be something that might scare off some people . It however helps for this particular movie to set the right tone and atmosphere for the entire movie and its dark , disturbing and depressing themes . A Buttgereit movie that I 'enjoyed ' watching . 7/10
When I heard that this movie was coming out the night before Halloween , I was very excited . When I found out that it was a book , written in 1978 , I had to read it before seeing the movie . I 'm sure the movie would have been much different to me if I had not read the book . The writers actually did a good job of staying true to the main plot of the book , with minor differences , naturally . I think the thing that disappointed me the most about the movie was Boyle playing the role of Col . I 'm not a big fan of Boyle , and it seems that no matter what the mood during the movie , she 's always trying to use her over-plumped lips , and darkly makeup-ed eyes to make herself seem super sexy . Indeed , I think that the movie held true to the genuine creepiness of the house . My favorite subplot was the Sheehan family ( which is so weird b/c the son was killed in Iraq and in current events there is Casey Sheehan whose mother went on a huge anti-Iraq tirade ) . In the book , obviously the war was not Iraq , but rather , Vietnam , and when the house turns on that video of the son in the helicopter , I was truly creeped out . Overall , I was impressed with the movie , in that it followed the book very well .
Adorable ! I saw Domestic Import in Philly in October with my kids . We all liked it so much that we saw it a second time with my parents . I have n't heard them laugh like that in years ! It was the first time that I can remember seeing a movie that my parents and my kids could enjoy . It 's really cute and we ca n't wait for it to come out on DVD . They need to make more movies like Domestic Import . It is refreshing to go to a movie that three different generations can enjoy ( and not be embarrassed ) . I have not seen a movie this cute since My Big Fat Greek Wedding . I loved Mindy Sterling as the mother . She was also in Austin Powers . Howard Hesseman is in this too and he is hilarious . I remember him from WKRP .
A lot of people unfairly sh ! t on this series but several of the Guinea Pig videos are fairly entertaining . Devil 's Experiment in particular has some really fantastic effects work -- not just the infamous eyeball scene but also a very realistic skin slice on the foot and a hand breaking with a sledgehammer are very realistic -- especially for the video 's vintage and low-budget . Let me start at the beginning now for those who do n't know : This film is an `` extreme '' torture/fake snuff film that surfaced in Japan in the mid-80s . It 's plot as it stands is simple : A young girl is held by a few men and forced to undergo a series of brutal tortures to see where her breaking point is . This entails brutal violence -- all effectively realistic effects including the ones mentioned in the last paragraph as well as a painful looking application of hot oil to the captive girl 's arm and placing of maggots in the subsequent flaky wound . The least effective sequences are at the very beginning of the video and consist of an unconvincing slap session where three men take turns slapping the hell out of the girl as her head falls about and a second sequence where the three men take turns kicking the girl and pushing her to the ground . These two scenes are obviously staged and detract from the realism of the rest of the proceedings . The actress who plays the victim of the `` experiment '' is pretty convincing at being in pain and takes a good amount of abuse and rough stuff on camera . Her reactions as she has headphones strapped to her head and loud noises are played for hours on end are chilling . Some of the other abuse she takes is being strung up in a net from a tree during the only times she is given a rest . Also there is a disturbing scene where the giggling captors through guts at her and one other disgustingly sleazy scene where she is spun in an office chair and forced to drink a bottle of Jack Daniels till she pukes . If you have n't seen this series I hope I have helped you decide whether or not you want to give this episode a shot . 8.5/10 for Devil 's Experiment .
John Schlesinger 's 'Midnight Cowboy ' is perhaps most notable for being the only X-rated film in Academy history to receive the Oscar for Best Picture . This was certainly how I first came to hear of it , and , to be completely honest , I did n't really expect much of the film . This is not to say that I thought it would be horrible , but somehow I did n't consider it the sort of movie that I would enjoy watching . This is one reason why you should never trust your own instincts on such manners  a remarkable combination of stellar acting , ambitious directing and a memorable soundtrack ( `` Everybody 's talking ' at me , I do n't hear a word they 're sayin ' '' ) make this film one of the finest explorations of life , naivety and friendship ever released . Young Joe Buck ( then-newcomer Jon Voight ) , dressed proudly as a rodeo cowboy , travels from Texas to New York to seek a new life as a hustler , a male prostitute . Women , however , do not seem to be willing to pay money for his services , and Joe faces living in extreme poverty as his supply of money begins to dry up . During these exploits , Joe comes to meet Enrico `` Ratso '' Rizzo ( Dustin Hoffman ) , a sickly crippled swindler who initially tries to con Joe out of all his money . When they come to realise that they are both in the same predicament , Ratso offers Joe a place to stay , and , working together , they attempt to make ( largely dishonest ) lives for themselves in the cold , gritty metropolis of New York . Joe had convinced himself that New York women would be more than willing to pay for sex ; however , his first such business venture ends with him guiltily paying the woman ( Sylvia Miles ) twenty dollars . Though he might consider himself to be somewhat intelligent , Ratso is just as naïve as Joe . Ratso , with his painful limp and hacking cough , is always assuring himself that , if only he could travel to the warmth of Miami , somehow everything would be all right . This misguided expectation that things will get better so easily is quite reminiscent of Lennie and George of John Steinbeck 's classic novel , 'Of Mice and Men . ' Shot largely on the streets of New York , 'Midnight Cowboy ' is a grittily-realistic look at life in the slums . Watching the film , we can almost feel ourselves inside Ratso 's squalid , unheated residence , our joints stiff from the aching winter cold . The acting certainly contributes to this ultra-realism , with both Voight and Hoffman masterfully portraying the two decadent dregs of modern society . Hoffman , in particular , is exceptional in his role ( I 'm walkin ' here ! I 'm walkin ' here ! `` ) , managing to steer well clear of being typecast after his much-lauded debut in 1967 's 'The Graduate . ' Both stars were later nominated for Best Actor Oscars ( also nominated for acting  bafflingly  was Sylvia Miles , for an appearance that ca n't have been for more than five minutes ) , though both ultimately lost out to John Wayne in 'True Grit . ' 'Midnight Cowboy ' eventually went on to win three Oscars from seven nominations , including Best Picture , Best Director for Schlesinger and Best Writing for Waldo Salt . 'Midnight Cowboy ' is told mainly in a linear fashion , though there are numerous flashbacks that hint at Joe 's past . Rather than explicitly explaining what these brief snippets are actually about , the audience is invited to think about it for themselves , and how these circumstances could have led Joe onto the path he is now pursuing . The achingly-beautiful final scene leaves us with a glimmer of hope , but a large amount of uncertainty . Gritty , thought-provoking and intensely fascinating , 'Midnight Cowboy ' is one for the ages .
getting to work on this film when it was made back in the summer of 1990 . Shot partly in the Biltmore Estate in Asheville , NC and the remaining parts in Winston-Salem . The massive offices of the RJ Reynolds were used in several office scenes and places in around the beautiful city that is know as the tulip capital of the world Winston-Salem ! I enjoyed my work although it was exceedingly hard work building all the sets like the Golf of Mexico where Renee Russo and Jim Belushi went on their date . I also had a big hand in decorating the bar where Larry encounters the magical bartender Mr. Destiny . I tacked all those pics on the wall of sports heroes and decorated that phone booth where larry makes a phone call for a cab . I even put my mothers photo at eye level so i could freeze frame it and show it to her when we watched it . I remember dyeing the grass at his old house with green dye because it first had to be sodded ( it was a new house in a new development and I guess they leased it for the movie ) ..then I had to cut that newly laid sod to make it look nice..man that was hard ! As far as the movie , when we made it we had no idea what it would be like but after seeing it i fell in love with it because really tells the story of `` what if '' as good as I ever had seen it , including the great It 's a Wonderful Life . I cried so many times i ca n't count . I got to meet the wonderful actor Michael Caine while shooting scenes at an old minor league ballpark where Larry 's boyhood scenes were played and replayed . I remember after he had done a take an was heading back to his trailer , I ran him down and asked him for a picture and he was quite amiable and said `` why not ! '' He is a good guy and a really natural and forceful actor . I ca n't say the same for Jim Belushi..he was so full of himself , smoking big cuban cigars and talking loudly so everyone in earshot could hear his every word . His career never did take off but he has had a decent TV career recently . I would say watch this movie if you ever get the chance . It 's wonderful and really heartfelt and real . You can feel Larry 's pain after he enters into the new world Mr. Destiny gives him after hitting the homer , and as he wants so badly for people to believe he is not this bad guy everyone thinks he is . They all think he belongs in a nuthouse ! But eventually he wins people over but by then he wants his real life back so badly , especially his wonderful wife , played so beautifully by Linda Hamilton..and he wants his dog back ! So see it .
With rapid intercutting of scenes of insane people in an asylum , and montage/superimposition of images , and vague , interwoven narratives , this is a very hard movie to follow . Apparently a man ( Masue Inoue ) takes a job as a porter or janitor in an asylum so he can be near his imprisoned wife , and maybe to rescue her . But she 's clearly mad , huddled on the floor , with a vacant expression much of the time and fear , misery , and confusion written on her face the rest of the time . The film-maker switches to her point of view sometimes , and we see vague images of her at the side of a pond drowning a baby , or clutching at a drowned child . She 's tormented by something . When the point of view shifts to her or other mad folks , the filmmaker uses distorting lenses and such things , showing us what mad people see and then how they react . And the place is swarming with mad folks , laughing , hiding , and in one case dancing frenetically night and day . At one point the man tries to take his wife outside , but the night outside the door terrifies her and she runs back to her cell . Gradually the man slips into a nightmare in which he 's interrupted in another attempt to steal her away , and he kills the doctor and many attendants , and all the while the mad folk laugh and applaud . When he wakes he is relieved , and mops the floor . Some fascinating shots of Japanes life , streets , buildings in the 1920s .
What a movie ! I never imagined Richard Attenborough could have such a movie in him . Gandhi has always left me indifferent , apart from Ben Kingsley 's performance , and I never considered Attenborough a particularly good filmmaker . But Cry Freedom held my interest like few movies have in recent times . It 's an exciting , mesmerizing political movie with great performances by Kevin Kline and a young Denzel Washington . Kline plays Donald Woods , a South Africa newspaper editor who befriends the civil rights activist Steve Biko . It starts as a difficult friendship , for Woods sees Biko as a black supremacist preaching hatred against whites . But Biko , with his kind words , upbeat attitude and complete transparency , wins over Woods and introduces him to a reality about Apartheid that Woods knew nothing about . Biko is a decent , law-abiding citizen who altruistically stands up against all prejudice and the system that keeps down his people . One night , coming from an illegal meeting , he 's arrested and beaten to death . The authorities try to hush up the matter because Biko has become a huge personality in South Africa . But through the efforts of Woods the truth comes out . But what should be a triumph only becomes a nightmare as Woods and his family become targets for the secret police . This movie has an interesting structure . It has in fact two narratives : first it narrates the life and death of Biko . It 's an amazing first half , completely dominated by the charisma of Washington in what may be his greatest performance yet . The second half , no less interesting , narrates Woods attempt to escape from South Africa to publish a book about Biko . Woods has become an enemy of state , a banned person , which means he ca n't meet people or leave his country . Plus he 's constantly spied by the police . Kevin Kline gives a great performance in this second half too . Although the first half is quite straightforward , the second does interesting things with editing , by giving flashbacks of Biko and of events that show the repression against the black South Africans . Some may argue this is to make it more interesting , but for me the second half just as captivating , as Woods and his family devise a bold plan to escape South Africa . The last minutes were so heartbreaking I was in tears . George Fenton and Jonas Gwangwa 's score certainly had something to do with it . Although I 've never been much of a fan of Fenton ( can not stand his Gandhi score ) , I do think the score for Cry Freedom is one of the most beautiful ever composed for cinema . The movie , thanks to the music married to the powerful images , at times reached incredible peaks of emotion . Cry Freedom is definitely not a movie just to watch because of Denzel Washington . This is a movie to be cherished in its entirety . Acting , writing , music , editing , cinematography come together in a perfect synthesis to create an ode to the power of the human spirit . This movie deserve a place alongside movies like The Pianist , Life Is beautiful and The Shawshank Redemption .
The more I watch Nicholas Cage , the more I appreciate him as an actor . Watching this movie now ( in 2005 ) , I can see that it does n't really fit into the genre of movies that was coming out in the early 90s . I do n't really think it can be considered a film noir , but it is pretty dark at times , due mostly to the lighting and odd personalities of the characters . Typical performances from each of the three main actors , who all did a good job with their roles . I thought , however , that Hopper and Boyle 's characters were left undeveloped , as it was sometimes hard to understand what they were doing and why they were doing it . Hopper is a love him or hate him kind of guy . The plot is really good , and although I found some parts to be very unrealistic , there were parts where I had to hand it to the director ( i.e . when he first sees the sheriff ) . All in all , this movie is definitely worth watching . ***1/2
Holes is an awesome movie . I love it a lot and it 's one of my favorite films . It 's one of the few flicks produced by Disney that is n't cheesy . Holes is generally a very cool motion picture . I wish Disney would make more pictures like it . Holes is indeed a rare breed of Disney flicker shows that is cool . Do n't get the wrong idea , I do n't mean to bad mouth Disney but most of it 's stuff is aimed towards kids and THAT 'S OKAY . Children deserve to have their entertainment too . But Disney has been guilty of trying to appeal to the teen audience and they usually fail . But not with Holes . It 's the type of movie anyone of any age can watch and enjoy and not once think it 's corny . Really , it 's the kind of movie that even a lot of young hoods might enjoy since there are characters in it that they can relate to . Holes does a good job of being a mix of good family entertainment but not being too cheesy and living a little on the edge . I hope Disney takes more risks and makes more edgy flicks like this .
Pecker is a hilariously funny yet twisted film about a small town in Baltimore whose daily , humdrum routine is broken by Pecker , a young photographer who takes pictures of `` real things . '' No pretty models , no gorgeous men , just hard living . This wonderful film pokes fun at the plasticness of the urban art chain . There is one particular scene when a homeless woman who shops at Pecker 's mom 's thrift shop buys the same exact coat as one of the Whitney art junkies for only 25 cents instead of five hundred dollars . This just goes to show you that no matter what kind of money you have , you might not always have taste . Yet again John Waters sends you into a never-ending spiral of laughter and raw reality . You can have your mainstream Hollywood movies with special affects and mountains of celebrities , but give me a `` Pecker '' or a `` Hairspray '' ( another excellent John Waters film ) over a `` Titanic '' or a `` Godzilla '' anyday ! !
William Powell 's final outing as Philo Vance occurs in The Kennel Murder Case where the murder of a championship show dog leads to two more murders and one attempt of the human kind . It 's all in the figuring out of how that leads to the who and why . The Philo Vance murders by S.S. Van Dine were most popular at the time and the clever Mr. Van Dine figured out a way to sell his books one at a time to the highest studio bidder . This is why you see so many Philo Vances and so many studios putting them out . Had Bill Powell not gone on to greater fame with MGM as Nick Charles of the Thin Man series , he would have been known as the greatest of Philo Vances . It turns out that Powell had entered his little terrier Captain in the same contest where the murdered dog was entered and then another rival owner became the first murder victim . As usual Powell shows up Eugene Palette as Sergeant Heath whose biggest contribution to the proceedings was using his bulk to break down the locked from the inside door where the first murder victim was found . I did say locked from the inside and it was an upper story so it was in figuring out the how . Powell has a lovely group of suspects , as extensive as what normally is in a Thin Man mystery . People like Paul Cavanaugh , Helen Vinson , Ralph Morgan , Mary Astor , fill their cast roles well . Warner Brothers liked this version so much that in fact they remade it again in the Thirties with James Stephenson in his one and only outing as Philo Vance . It does n't hold a candle to this one . As this is the only Powell Philo Vance that is out on VHS or DVD by all means see this one or acquire it if you can .
If you 've ever seen the trailer for the film `` The Recruit '' with Colin Farrell and Al Pacino , you 'll never have to see that film . Sadly , Renaissance has had similarly revelatory trailer makers . The story of Renaissance is about a detective investigating the kidnapping of a young woman and medical researcher . The setting is a futuristic Paris , and science fiction elements feature throughout . The special thing about Renaissance , though , is its visual style , and not its story . Renaissance is 3D computer animation , like Final Fantasy , but highly stylised into black and white with ultra sharp contrasts . The result looks stunning ( although the problems of 3D animation of human beings are still noticeable from time to tome : slightly robotic movements , slightly wooden facial acting , etc ) As a highly stylised , beautiful film noir , Renaissance succeeds at stunning the audience , especially visually . The story and writing , though , are not quite at the same level of quality as the visuals . It 's not a bad story ( and presumably , if you have n't seen the trailer , it 's a lot more exciting than it was for me ) . But it is a story that is n't highly original , and verges on the corny . A few lines of dialogue were painfully corny , making the writing sound like a beginner 's first efforts . I will definitely recommend Renaissance to friends . It 's unlike anything I 've seen before , visually , and I believe its originality alone makes it a worthwhile experience . It is also a watchable story , even if it is n't perfect .
Scientist working frantically in seclusion finds a way to locate the impact crater of a meteor carrying a new radioactive element . All ( pseudo ) science and breakthrough technology talks of the 1930s are right there , including the idea that radioactivity could heal any illness if properly harnessed . When he summons his rivals -who had cast him out of the scientific community and ridiculed him - to witness his discovery , they propose a 'joint ' expedition to Africa ... of course they end up stealing much of dr. Rukh 's original discovery , giving him only residual credit . In addition to that , an effeminate weakling who looks like a supporting comedy actor from the worst Abbot & Costello ( Lawton ) literally steals dr. Rukh 's young trophy wife ( Drake ) , who falls head over heels for that scrap of a human being . Having grown horns like a deer was n't going to make dr. Rukh ( Karloff ) any friendlier , so he embarks in an undercover revenge mission ... killing 2 of his foes and friendly dr. Benet ( Lugosi ) , the only one who had helped him ... finally succumbing to the deadly radiations that had allowed him to embark in his revenge to start with but ( to my utmost dissatisfaction ) sparing the adulteress and that poor excuse for a human being she had married . Acting is mostly fine , with Karloff & Lugosi being very good . Check the hysterical chambermaid scene ... Other characters are n't worth mentioning ... Recommended , much like ALL old Universal horrors ...
This stirring western spins the tale of the famous rifle of the early west that was coveted by one and all . James Stewart is the cowboy who wins the prized Winchester in a shootout , only to lose it in a robbery . The story details Stewart 's pursuit of the rifle and a certain man through the film . The rifle changes hands time after time , as though the owner is fated to lose it through violence . The picture has plenty of action and suspense as Stewart closes in on his quarry . A great cast supports Stewart here , namely Stephen McNally , Dan Duryea , Millard Mitchell , John McIntire and Jay C. Flippen . Shelley Winters seems miscast here and the purpose of her role is rather obscure . Tony Curtis and Rock Hudson , teen heartthrobs in later years , have brief but good roles .
I was lucky enough to attend a screening in Stockholm for this elegantly expressed , enjoyable , and thought-provoking film . With romance as the heaviest weapon in its arsenal , Paris je t'aime boldly plunges into love in Paris , navigating the different forms in eighteen separate `` quartiers '' but without pouting Parisiennes and saccharine formulas . Its goldmine undoubtedly stems from frustration on the directors ' parts  frustration over only having 5-10 minutes of screen time  thereby you are only presented with the best and most assured direction from each party . Debating whether or not I should review all 18 segments , I reached the conclusion that it would be merely redundant and long-winded . Instead simply rest assured that each director graces the film with their eccentric styles and skills , and certainly you 'll find your favourite . Although Gus Van Sant can not resist the temptation to be introspective , his LES MARAIS is one of the better contributions , even sneaking in a well-placed Kurt Cobain reference . The Coen brothers recreate one of the more accessible segments in Paris , a scene with a muted but emotionally transparent Steve Buscemi , deadpan humour and clever camera angles that surely generated the most laughter in my theatre , and perhaps rightly so . In this way , all story lines are exquisitely unique  filtered through the minds of different directors  but the one that deviates the most from the rest is Vincenzo Natali 's QUARTIER DE LA MADELEINE , a dark horror-Gothic love starring Elijah Wood as a lost tourist in the backstreets of Paris in the night who meets a vampiress . With a black-and-white format but blood-red colour contrast that seems to incongruously bleed off screen , it nearly becomes a pastiche of Sin City  a refreshing eerie and visual turn in an otherwise fairly grounded film . Yet my single favourite segment was FAUBOURG SAINT-DENIS by Tom Tykwer but I think I was conditioned to think so , given that I went in the theatre with him as my favourite and nudged my friend in the side saying `` finally , that 's my favourite director here '' . Nevertheless , it can not be denied that Tykwer delivers a lovely segment in which a blind boy picks up the phone , and hears from his girlfriend ( Portman - for once not annoying ) that she breaks up with him , and he reflects on their relationship . As is Tywker 's style , the story is dizzyingly fast-paced , kinetic and repetitive , featuring screaming and running ( Lola Rennt ) making it the most adrenaline-pumping segment in Paris je t'aime and possibly also the most touching once Tywker starts wielding his most powerful tool  music . To fill the negative account , clearly not all directors manage as touching as Tywker , Van Sant , Cohens , Coixet and Dépardieu . Sylvain Chomet scrapes the bottom of the pile by carving out a truly disposable segment in which a little boy retells the story of how his parents met . They are two lonely mimes . This part is so in-your-face French and desperately quirky that it is insulting to international viewers . Suwa also directs a poor and fluffy segment with an unusually haggard-looking Juliette Binoche whom mourns the loss of her son . Nothing else happens . Finally , the wrap-up and interweaving of the 18 stories in the end feels somewhat rushed and half-hearted . Yet Paris je t'aime truly spoils you with quality , for all the other stories are well-crafted with crisp acting and amusing writing . It is certainly one of the highlights of 2006 ( not saying much , I suppose ) and a very personal film in the sense that it is unavoidable to pick a favourite and a least favourite . Highly recommended both to mainstream of `` pretentious '' ( heh ) audiences . 8 out 10
The late Dudley Moore had the most famous role of his too-short career in 1981 's ARTHUR , a raucously funny and alternately touching tale that generates warm smiles , big belly-laughs , and an occasional tear if you 're in the right mood . Moore received a Best Actor Oscar nomination for his performance as Arthur Bach , a drunken playboy who `` races cars , plays tennis , fondles women , but he has weekends off and he 's his own boss . '' Arthur is destined to inherit 750 million dollars when he marries a snooty society girl named Susan Johnston ( Jill Eikenberry ) who is the spoiled daughter of an undercover gangster . Things get sticky when Arthur meets Linda Morolla ( Liza Minnelli ) a waitress/struggling actress from Queens who steals neckties for her father 's birthday . Moore lights up the screen in one of the single funniest performances of the last 50 years . The late Sir John Gielgud won a Best Supporting Actor Oscar for his flawless turn as Arthur 's acid-tongued butler and best friend , Hobson , whose outward disdain for Arthur 's behavior covers more paternal feelings . There are other funny contributions by Barney Martin as Linda 's father . Stephen Elliott as Susan 's father , and Geraldine Fitzgerald as Arthur 's demented grandmother . The film was directed with a keen eye for comedy by a first time director named Steve Gordon , who , sadly , died the following the year . There was also a forgettable sequel several years later , but this instant classic is not to be missed .
This film , along with WESTFRONT 1918 , are my favorite Pabst-directed films and I enjoyed them more than his much more famous films which starred Louise Brooks ( such as PANDORA 'S BOX ) . It 's probably because both are very similar to the Neo-Realist films that the Italians perfected in the 1940s and 50s . This style film called for using non-actors ( just typical folks ) in everyday settings in order to create intensely involving and realistic films . In this case , the film is about French and German coal miners , so appropriately , the people in the roles seem like miners -- not actors . The central conflict as the film begins is that there is a huge mine located on the Franco-German border . Instead of one big mine , it is divided at the border and German workers are not welcome in the French mine , despite there being greater unemployment in Germany . This , language differences ( illustrated wonderfully in a dance hall scene ) and WWI conspire to create a huge rift between the factions -- resulting in a WE vs . THEY mentality . Later , an explosion causes a huge collapse in the French and the Germans refuse to sit back and do nothing . Risking their own lives , they prove that there is true comradeship between miners and men in general . The film is a strong criticism of xenophobia and tried , in vain , to get the German audiences to see the futility of war and hatred . It was a gorgeously moving film with some of the scariest and claustrophobic images I have ever seen . Considering history , though , the film 's impact was minimal at best . It 's a real shame , as like this one , WESTFRONT 1918 , JÁACCUSE ( Gance ) and ALL QUIET ON THE WESTERN FRONT ( Milestone ) had great messages of peace and harmony but ultimately were failures in positively swaying public opinion . So , from a historical point of view , it 's an amazing and sad relic that is well worth seeing .
The Sopranos is arguably the greatest show in Dramatic Television history . Its hard to think of another series that boasts so much intelligence , sublime writing or first rate performances . Across its epic scope it produces fresh and iconic characters and a constant level of high quality . Centering around the life of one Tony Soprano , a man who lives in two families . One is the conventional wife and two kids nuclear family the other a huge New Jersey Mafia group , of which he is the boss of both . Played by James Gandolfini , of True Romance and The Mexican fame , Tony is a fascinating , scary but also likable guy . Full praise must be given to Gandolfini for making a womanising and horrifically aggressive brute a genuinely identifiable and perfect leading man . Contemporay American drama has never had such an arresting and iconic figure as Tony . The cast of hundreds never boasts a flat performance and such stand out characters like Paulie Walnuts and Ralph Cifaretto will stick in your memory for ever . The true genius of this tale however , is the creator and writers bravery and revolutionary take on a conventional drama series . Twenty minute long dream sequences , powerful and original use of symbolism and metaphorical imagery and truly shocking scenes of violence . Yet all this style is met by truly touching themes of love , honour and respect for family . The series never becomes cold hearted or gratuitous . With TV now competitive and often poor The Sopranos stands tall above the rest as America 's most original and compelling drama . Forget Family Redifined . This is Television Redifined .
John Cassavetes ' 1977 film Opening Night is , what critics usually call the work of such a significant artist , 'overlooked ' . It is an excellent film , in its own right , and one of the best portraits of a midlife crisis ever put to film . It 's not a perfect film , in that , at two hours and twenty four minutes it 's about a half hour too long , and there 's a bit too much emphasis on the drunkenness of the lead character Myrtle Gordon , played by Gena Rowlands , the wife of Cassavetes , long after we 've gotten the point . But only Woody Allen 's masterpiece , Another Woman , which also starred Rowlands , eleven years later , is a better portrait of the internal conflicts of an aging woman . Yet , Rowlands did win the Best Actress Award at the Berlin Film Festival for this portrayal , and it was well deserved . Often this film , written by Cassavetes , is easily compared to his earlier- and inferior- film , A Woman Under The Influence , but it 's a spurious comparison . Rowlands ' character in that film is severely mentally disturbed from the start , as well as coming from a blue collar background , while her characters in this film and in Allen 's film are both artists who are haunted by apparitions . In this film it 's the ghost of a dead young woman who can be seen as Myrtle 's younger doppelganger , while in Allen 's film it 's her character 's own past . Many critics have taken this film to be a portrait of an alcoholic , seeing Myrtle surround herself with enablers , such as a stage manager who tells her , during opening night , 'I 've seen a lot of drunks in my time , but I 've never seen anyone as drunk as you who could stand up . You 're great ! ' , but this is wrong , for alcohol is n't her problem- nor is her chain smoking . They are merely diversions from whatever thing is really compelling her to her own destruction , and much to Cassavetes ' credit , as a storyteller , he never lets us find out exactly what 's wrong with Myrtle , and despite her coming through in the end , there 's no reason to expect that she has really resolved anything of consequence . This sort of end without resolution links Cassavetes directly with the more daring European directors of the recent past , who were comfortable in not revealing everything to an audience , and forcing their viewers to cogitate , even if it hurts . Yet , the film recapitulates perfectly the effect of a drunk or fever lifting out of the fog , and as such the viewer again is subliminally involved in its drama . Whether or not Myrtle Gordon does recover , after the film 's universe irises about her is left for each and every viewer to decide , and as we have seen before that lid closes , one 's choices do matter .
Ghost Story , ( The New House ) is a terrific horror story . This is from the Circle Of Fear and the Ghost Story series of the early seventies.The beginning and ending of each story is narrated by Sebastian Cabot . Remember him from the early family series , Family Affair in the 1960s ? This particular story has Barbara Parkins and David Birney as the lead actors , and as the main characters in the story.I saw this recently , and I was so scared ! If you are alone , I would not recommend that you watch this.This story is terrific , no gore or curse words , but very scary . Barbara Parkins played the young bride . David Birney played her husband.Both actors were very good in their parts.If you like scary , fun , terrifying ghost stories , then you will like this little gem . I gave this a high rating.I highly recommend this story .
This is my third comment here attempting to connect two legendary movie comedy teams : Laurel & Hardy and Abbott & Costello . The connection here is the year 1940 . That 's the date that the former had their last movie from their longtime home studio of Hal Roach . I 'll mention the significance of the latter later on . Besides being the last time Stan and Ollie worked at the Lot of Fun , it 's also the final time they would appear with such familiar supporting players like Charlie Hall and James Finlayson who appeared in most of their films . It 's also the last time Art Lloyd would serve as their cameraman and Marvin Hatley-who composed their theme song which would be known as `` The Cuckoo Song ( Dance of the Cuckoos ) '' -their score . And it would be the very last time Stan Laurel would be allowed to exercise complete creative control over what goes on film . If there is a more gag-laden structure than usual in this L & H film , it 's nice to know most of those gags are indeed funny . That includes most of the sound and visual effects , the latter provided by longtime Roach staffer Roy Seawright . In this one , Ollie has `` hornophobia '' from working at a noisy horn factory so Dr. Finlayson prescribes going out to sea for his rest . Ollie does n't like to go boating so Stan suggests they just rent one that 's docked so they would n't have to go anywhere . After they find one they like , we find out that convict Nick Grainger ( Richard Cramer ) has just escaped ... I 'll stop there and say this was as good a finale for L & H 's longtime home as one could hope for . It 's hilarious mostly from beginning to end and knowing this would be their last for the man partly responsible for their teaming is indeed poignant when one thinks of it . Oh , and I have a couple more lasts to mention : it 's the final film appearance of both Harry Bernard , who plays a harbor patrolman after years of encountering Stan and Ollie as a policeman , and that of Ben Turpin , the cross-eyed comic who was born in New Orleans which is a couple of hours away from my current hometown of Baton Rouge , whose second L & H appearance this was having previously `` married '' the boys in Our Wife . The latter performer especially has a genuine comic moment . All right , I mentioned 1940 being the year Stan and Ollie had their last movie released from Hal Roach Studios . It was also the first year that a comedy team , both born in the state of New Jersey , would make their first picture at what would be their home studio , Universal . The director of that movie would be the same one that guided L & H in The Flying Deuces the previous year . His name was A. Edward Sutherland . P.S . It was during this filming that script supervisor Virginia Lucille Jones had an accident involving a rolled-up carpet . That incident caused Oliver `` Babe '' Hardy to send her roses to her hospital room . They fell in love and married on March 7 , 1940 . It lasted until Babe 's death in 1957 .
Before viewing , please make sure you have seen Night of the Living Dead ... This might well be THE best 7 minute parody I have ever seen ! Absurd , crappy 'special effects ' ( the rope , the rope ! ! ! ) , and maneating slices of bread ... what more do you need ? ? ? ( Do not watch this movie while eating bread ... you might get scared ! )
Miriam Hopkins is `` The Lady with Red Hair '' in this 1940 biopic of Mrs. Leslie Carter which also stars Claude Rains as David Belasco , Richard Ainley as Lou Payne , and a fine cast of supporting players , including Laura Hope Crews and Victor Jory . Miriam Hopkins and Claude Rains give wonderful performances . Hopkins was a beautiful actress who really makes us feel for Mrs. Carter . Rains is great as the flamboyant , egotistical producer/writer/actor/impresario David Belasco , one of the great names in theater . Though Mrs. Carter 's second husband , Lou Payne , served as adviser on this film , it 's a poor representation of the real events of Mrs. Carter 's life . True , there was a much publicized and bitter divorce , and she was undoubtedly viewed as a scandalous character for that and for becoming an actress . However , she had custody of her son Dudley , so there was no custody battle . Once she broke with Belasco , she did not go back to him and , in fact , started working in vaudeville and actually made some films toward the end of her life . She did indeed marry Lou , and he became her leading man in many productions . The driving force for Mrs. Carter in the beginning of this film is regaining custody of her son , but she finally realizes that in her time away from him , he is thoroughly bonded with his father . In the film also ( and I 'm not sure if it was true in real life ) she traveled with her mother and lived in a theatrical boarding house , which gives the film some added interesting atmosphere . Not a bad movie , probably not a depiction of the greatness of either Carter or Belasco . One of Mrs. Carter 's most famous moments was in The Heart of Maryland , where she wore a wig with six-foot tresses . Off-stage , fans blew her hair as she hung 35 feet above the stage clutching the center of a bell to keep it from ringing . Quite a visual .
The Booth puts a whole new twist on your typical J-horror movie . This movie puts you in the shoes of the protagonist of the story . The director wants you to see what the protagonist sees and thinks . The story is about perception of the people who works , lives , and loves of our protagonist , and how he perceives the people who surrounds him in an antiquated radio station DJ booth . The story peels back the layers of the main character like an onion in flash-backs as the movie runs its course , and from it we learned that things are not always the way it seems . The movie mostly took place in a small , out-dated radio station 's studio with a very bad history , where the main character was forced to broadcast his talk show due to the radio station was in the process of re-locating . It is from this confined space that this movie thrives and makes you feel very claustrophobic and very paranoid . At time our protagonist can not determined the strange happenings in the old studio were caused by ghost or some conspiracy by his co-workers or it was all in his mind . What I like about this film is that the film-makers makes you see through the eyes of the main character and makes you just as paranoid as protagonist did . This movie is a very smart , abide rather short 76 minutes film .
Jim Carrey and Morgan Freeman along with Jennifer Aniston combine to make one of the funniest movies so far this 2003 season ( late May ) and a good improvement on Carrey 's past crazy and personally forgetable roles in past comedies . With a slightly toned down Carrey antics yet with just the zap and crackle of his old self , Carrey powerfully carries this movie to the height of laughter and also some dramatic , tearfully somber moments . Elements of Jim 's real acting abilities continue to show up in this movie . This delightful summer entertainment hits most of the buttons , including dramatic elements along with the goofy moments that fit perfectly with this script . While still lacking in the superbly polished ensemble of comedy/drama , Bruce , Almightly deserves credit for being a great date movie along with a solid message and soft spiritual cynicism and parody that maintains its good-natured taste . Eight out of ten stars .
I really have to say , this was always a favorite of mine when I went to see my grandma . And it still is . It is very , very close to the book . The way it is filmed , and the players were just all excellent ! I have to recommend this movie to everyone who has n't seen it . Almost everyone I talk to hates TV movies , but this was really great ! I gave it 10/10 .
The primary aspect of this film which most people miss is that Luhzin lives his life as a chess game . So many people have seen this film and just do n't get it , and I do n't understand why . While watching this film I was taken on a private journey which floored me . I will try to explain this without any spoilers , but be forewarned , I do talk about things that happen in the movie . **** Possible Spoilers **** Be Forewarned ! **** His is a life of `` large moves '' versus `` small moves '' . He chooses Natalia to be his Queen , and he and she behave as his Aunt first described the King and Queen and their moves when she introduced him to chess as a boy . Listen closely to that description . When someone asks him a question , he flashbacks to the past as if reviewing past moves . ( The flashbacks are beautifully lit , by the way . ) The flashbacks are quite interesting as well , for they give not only his point of view as a child , but the point of view of the other character as well . It 's stunning . Various characters become either his helpers or his enemies , pawns , bishops and knights , their actions enlightening you as to who 's side they are on . Even their placement in a scene is pivotal to understanding what is going on . Beautifully done . I will not comment more on what happens to the character of Luhzin , but I hope that this will illuminate what is actually happening at the end . This film is constantly working on many levels , which is why I endorse it . It was a treat and a joy to watch . If you like this film I would recommend a film called Fresh . The only way that these films are similar is the use of chess and the characters being treated as pieces .
Now this show looks like most of the other shows of it 's type from the mid-90 's , but the only thing is about this one is that it 's different , they use a lot of comedy and action in this one and maybe a little bit of drama too . I personally thought it was a good show , I ca n't understand why would they cancel it . The good thing is that the fan base of this show is still alive ever since 1997 up to date . My hopes is that the WB bring back the show or even do a movie , which I know is gon na be impossible to do , but hey it does n't hurt to dream , does n't it ? Anyway , I would recommend if you had n't seen it to find the DVD of all 13 episodes , because the characters are great , the story lines are good , the comedy is good and well the whole show is just great .
I should say at the outset there are many , many things I love about 'Forbidden Planet ' and yes , I certainly consider it a 'classic ' science-fiction film for many reasons . But the adulation it has received over the years goes a bit over the top in my opinion . No less an authority than Leonard Maltin says 'Forbidden Planet ' `` ... is one of the most ambitious and intelligent movies of its genre . '' Ambitious ? Without a doubt . Intelligent ? Depends on what part of the film you 're talking about . It certainly was the most prestigious and highly-budgeted science-fiction flick to that point . At a cost of nearly $ 2 million ( this was 1956 , remember ) , MGM pulled out all the stops to produce a dazzling , eye-popping outer space adventure unlike anything seen on the big screen before , even employing artists from the Disney studio for some of the more elaborate special effects . 'Charming ' is not usually a word used to describe special effects in sci-fi movies , yet that is the one that seems most appropriate here . Even the dreaded 'Monster from the Id ' is only a well-rendered cartoon figure by the Disney people , unlikely to frighten anyone over the age of 8 . When I see the various sets and take note of the art design , models , costumes , etc. , I am reminded of nothing so much as 'The Wizard of Oz , ' with its gorgeously saturated colors and elaborate if not always convincing effects . So much work has gone into these films that one is inclined to smile in admiration at the effort regardless . 'Forbidden Planet ' is wonderful to look at . The scenes take place on obvious stage sets that are fabulously decorated , matte paintings of planets and space in the background , and intricately designed miniature sand dunes and so forth to give the illusion of depth . It 's a bit like watching the most elaborately-produced stage play you 'd ever see . The most believable and convincing scenes are probably the ones inside the massive Krell complex , where shots showing the vast depth and width of this inner space are well-done and credible . But then we get to the actors , darn it . The performances are almost uniformly awful , though in fairness one has to say the dialogue hardly ever transcends the level of adolescent locker-room humor , except for some passages of barely adequate scientific technobabble . Even the great actor Walter Pidgeon is reduced to giving such a hammy performance , it 's lugubrious at times . A very young Leslie Nielsen stars as the spaceship commander J.J. Adams , and does n't convey an ounce of believability or conviction in the entire film . He seems to instinctively know , thirty years ahead of time , that his true forte ' lay in comedy , as there are times he seems barely able to keep a straight face reciting his lines . Every forced reaction , whether it is anger or passion or solemn meditation , looks right out of a high school play . Anne Francis , also very young , fares a little better as the supposedly innocent Alta , whom we are to believe has never seen a human male other than her father until the crew of the spaceship shows up . ( Alta Morbius , now there 's a name for you . ) Unfortunately , even at this early age , Anne Francis seems about as virginal and naive as Elizabeth Taylor in 'Butterfield 8 . ' There is a good story here , buried somewhere beneath the crew-mates ' leering comments about Alta and yet another juvenile subplot concerning Earl Holliman 's 'Cookie , ' ship 's cook . ( Holliman turns in a horrendous performance too . I 'm guessing all these actors went straight from this movie to acting school . ) Based on Shakespeare 's 'The Tempest , ' the story of a dead race , the Krell , and the fantastic world of machines they left behind is what most people tend to remember about 'Forbidden Planet , ' and for good reason . For a few minutes here and there , you can forget about the rest of the movie and be dazzled by the Disney artists ' conception of the Krell underground complex . Is it enough to make up for the rest of the film 's shortcomings ? You 'll have to decide that on your own . Oh , and of course there 's Robby the Robot , every 1950 's ten-year-old 's idea of what a robot should look and talk like . He 's funny . In places . So , 'Forbidden Planet ' to me is a very , VERY mixed bag . It deserves credit for being the inspiration for a whole wave of sci-fi films and TV shows that followed , not least of which was 'Star Trek . ' But I would suggest that anyone who thinks it 's more than well-staged comic book sci-fi go back and watch it again .
I had heard this film was a study of a landscape photographer 's art by presenting the beauty in man 's deconstructing the natural landscape . It certainly showed the laborious activities to find locations , setup shots , and capture stark images whose final destinations were art studios worldwide . Put together in moving pictures it is truly a horror show . This film oozes by you supplanting the shock of ghastly images with gentle waves of a wonderful industrial soundtrack that guides you like on slow moving river . Each sequence stands on its own , but in combination you get deeper and deeper into the feeling of overwhelming inevitability . There are few words , this allowing the grandeur in what is shown to preach in its own way . An awful , massive factory filled with human automata who live in hopelessly lifeless dormitories . Individuals dying early while rummaging for recyclable scraps in mountains of our E-waste . The birthing of gigantic ships and their destruction by hand in giant graveyards . The construction of the Three Gorges Dam , the largest industrial project in human history and likely for all time . The time lapse as a city dies and is simultaneously reborn into a replica of modernity that purposefully destroys all relics of the culture that was . The most terrifying image for me was a dam engineer explaining that the most important function of the dam was flood control . The shot shifts to the orchard behind the spokesperson where you witness the level of the last flood by the toxic water having eaten the bark from the trees , demonstrating that nothing but the most hideous vermin could be living in the waters . The obvious not being stated is far more powerful than your normal preachy Save the Earth documentaries . The artist Edward Burtynsky explains the method wonderfully . 'By not saying what you should see many people today sit in an uncomfortable spot where you do n't necessarily want to give up what we have but we realize what we 're doing is creating problems that run deep . It is not a simple right or wrong . It needs a whole new way of thinking ' . The subtlety of this descends into an either/or proposition , but the film images scream that the decision has very much been made in favor of the dark side . Though never stated directly in any way , as the waves of what you witness wash away from your awareness and you contemplate , there is only one conclusion possible we are doomed . The progress of mankind that is inexorable from our natures leaves behind carnage that this artist finds terrifying beauty in . What he is actually capturing are the tracks of we the lemmings rushing unconsciously toward our own demise . Unlike most films with environmental themes , this one ends with no call to arms . It argues basically what 's the point , but makes certain you place the blame properly on all of us equally .
I loved this show so much and I 'm so incredibly sad its canceled i thought it came back too , but just two stupid weeks . Thats terrible . i hate how we never find out how everyone ends up . it sucks . Bring it back ! ABC has stupid shows like Supernanny and whatnot but does n't give time to good ones like Six Degrees . If they 're complaining about ratings it was probably because they had a bad slot because this was truly a good show , something I could relate to and anticipated . JJ Abrams delivered , he 's awesome , I wish ABC could just trust him enough to complete the story . I loved the entire cast too . I could n't wait to see how everyone would someday meet each other at once . Everyone 's story is now left incomplete , now I 'll never know if Steven and Whitney would get together or Carlos and Mae . I wanted to see what would happen to Laura or Damien and everyone else . This is really such a downer .
this movie is not porn , it was not meant to be porn , and unless my uncle runs for president of the world it should never be considered porn . now that that issue was sorted out , i can say i thoroughly recommend this film , as it 's issues are still widely available . it 's funny , the acting is great and it raises serious ( curious ) questions . i ca n't fully understand why this film was so mistreated , probably this is why i plan to never visit the us . Lena is the true pioneer of the modern riot-grrrl movement , confusion , curiosity and wit are her main attributes , she is occasionally angry , but are n't we all ?
I love this movie ! 10 out of 10 hands down ! It is that damn good ! I am not much of a fan of movies but I got ta tell you this one opened my eyes . Astounding color and fast energy . I was fortunate to catch this at a screening during the Zoinks ! Film Festival in Boston , and the story really enveloped me from the start . It had a lot of adult themes and character and when it ended I wanted more . I hope they make a sequel . That would be fun . My only problem with it is the performance of Melissa Connor as Anya . UGH ! She SUCKS ! I 've seen a block of wood pull out a better performance . I do n't what the director was thinking when he cast her . But if you ignore her you ca n't help but give this movie a big ten ! ! !
I liked this TV show because it was it 's own thing a girl who is on her sixteenth birthday finds out that she is a witch and her she lives with her aunties in the house and they are both witches as well . Well this took her about a few weeks of getting used to . When she used her powers for the first time it was so funny because she turned her enemy into a pineapple . She had to turn back time and repeat a day . This series is really cool and it is a typical teenage series but it wore thin when she moved out of her house and to an apartment with her fellow college friends and then it got boring and I stopped watching.I loved her aunties they were so funny and the other one was really ditzy . I loved Valerie and I hated Sabrina 's enemy Libby she was ugly .
This is an excellent film for female body-builder & female action fans ! I think that Sue Price did a great job in this film series ( Nemesis 2,3,4 ) and proved to be a great fighter . She has a very striking appearance and a will of iron to resist the powerful Nebula ( Nemesis 2 ) . Though not a film of great value and Sue Price 's acting skills not the best to have met in my life , the movie itself was something awesome , a priceless gem for fans of female body-builder action ! Well , some parts of Nemesis 2 have been copied by other famous sci-fi films , such as Terminator or Predator , but that 's not the point . The point is that A.Puyn casted in that film a very talented body-builder who put all of her energy and body talent to show us the best she can do . I really enjoyed that film and watched with the same enthusiasm Nemesis 3 ( a rather boring sequel ) and Nemesis 4 ( a much more interesting sequel than 3 ) . What a pity it has n't shown yet on DVD : - (
Tho 35 years old , Groove Tube looks a lot like actual TV today ! Specialty niche networks ( nude sports ) , a TV show about stoner drug dealers called the Dealers ( ala Weeds , and even predating 1978 's Cheech & Chong Up In Smoke ) , weird beer commercials ( Butz Beer , no less bizarre than Bud Bowls ) , dirty-minded kid 's clown Koko ( shades of Pee Wee Herman ) , even Chevy Chase doing slapstick humor ( a violent barbershop vocal duo ) a year before his 1975 debut on Saturday Night Live . And thanks to the infamous opening sequence that earned Groove Tube an initial X-rating , I still ca n't hear Curtis Mayfield 's `` Move On Up '' without thinking of naked dancing hitchhiking hippies -- -- For similar sketch-style movies , see TunnelVision , Kentucky Fried Movie , Amazon Women on the Mood , Monty Python 's Beyond the Fringe , Dynamite Chicken , and the Firesign Theatre 's Everything You Know is Wrong .
This 1998 film was based on a script by the late Edward D. Wood , a script that featured NO dialogue in the tradition of films such as THE THIEF . While much of Wood 's work was quirky low-budget entries into various genre-film traditions , his first released feature GLEN OR GLENDA was a truly visionary attempt to express the inexpressible through primitive avant-garde techniques . I WOKE UP EARLY THE DAY I DIED represents THAT side of Ed Wood , the experimenter , although this film is a comedy ( a nightmarish comedy , however ! ) , while the cross-dressing theme of GLEN OR GLENDA was taken so seriously by Wood that there was not room for comedy there . From the first few seconds of this film I knew that I was being taken to a new cinematic world , and I ca n't really compare that world with anything else . The technical side of the film -- production design , sound design , music scoring , photography , etc. -- is groundbreaking on any number of levels . In particular , although the film has no `` dialogue '' there is sound of all kinds and also `` language '' , but you 'll have to see how it 's done yourself , as the cleverness and surprise of the methods provides a level of excitement throughout . The Glen or Glenda-esque technique of juxtaposing stock footage for surreal effects works well in the film and is kept to a minimum . The whole film is played at a hysterical fever-pitch , and Billy Zane provides an amazing tour-de-force performance that shows what a brilliant physical comedian and actor he is . In a just world , he would have been given some award for this performance . He even LOOKS like Ed Wood , and as played by Zane this character is at various timesfunny , sleazy , tragic , sympathetic , and anonymous ( sometimes simultaneously ! ! ! ) . What a shame that this film was caught up in legal troubles and never received a North American theatrical or video release , only playing a few festivals . Right now , it 's only available on video in Germany ( in fact , my copy is from a German source -- the excerpts from Wood 's screenplay that are shown on the screen from time to time are translated into german , although the newspaper headlines ( that great low-budget technique of giving plot elements , especially those that would be too expensive to film , via newspaper headlines is used here in the Wood tradition ) that Zane sees are in English ) . I think that this film could have gotten a word-of-mouth following had it been played at midnight in some large cities with some careful promotion . And if played off city by city slowing on the art-film circuit , it could have done well . In fact , if the legal issues can be resolved , I 'd like to suggest that the film should STILL be given a theatrical release , especially a MIDNIGHT `` cult '' release . This is a classic waiting to be discovered . Did I `` understand '' every scene ? No , but I `` felt '' every scene emotionally . Did everything `` work '' in the film ? Perhaps not . I 've only seen it twice , and the first time I saw it I was interruped a number of times . However , with all the assembly-line junk playing the multiplexes and with so much `` alternative '' film being fetishistic or pretentious shot-on-video film-school rejects , we need actual Hollywood-made experimentation like this . The recent Bob Dylan film `` Masked and Anonymous '' took similar chances as did something like Steven Soderbergh 's FULL FRONTAL . This film could find an audience much larger than either of those . If you are reading this review a few years from now and the idea of this film sounds intriguing , see if it has ever been released on video . You will NOT be bored . Invite some friends over ... make it a party . Play the amazing soundtrack LOUD . I have a feeling that , wherever he is in the afterlife , Ed Wood is happy with this film and feels as though his unique vision has been justified and validated somewhat by the making of this film . Wood 's probably also laughing that , just like he always seemed to get the bad breaks in life , the film made in tribute to him after his death is held up in lawsuits and sits unreleased in the country of its making .
I thought that The sentinel was going to be a mediocre movie.When I finally saw it , I took a good surprise.The movie is n't great thing but it 's very fun and the action scenes are very well done.This movie reminded me TV series like 24 or Alias.It 's very similar to that series and it reminded me too , to the Wolfgang Petersen 's thriller In the line of fire.If you 're going to expect one of the most original and and one of the greatest thrillers in the history of movies , you will be disappointed.But if you go with little expectations , you will enjoy The sentinel . Rating:7
Stargate SG-1 is a spin off of sorts from the 1994 movie `` Stargate . '' I am so glad that they decided to expand on the subject . The show gets it rolling from the very first episode , a retired Jack O'Neill has to go through the gate once more to meet with his old companion , Dr. Daniel Jackson . Through the first two episodes , we meet Samantha Carter , a very intelligent individual who lets no one walk over her , and there is Teal'c , a quiet , compassionate warrior who defies his false god and joins the team . The main bad guys are called the Gouald , they are parasites who can get inserted into one 's brain , thus controlling them and doing evil deeds . Any Gouald who has a massive amount of power is often deemed as a `` System Lord . '' The warriors behind the Gouald are called Jaffa , who house the parasitic Gouald in their bodies until the Gouald can get inserted in a person 's brain . Through the episodes , we mostly get to see SG-1 , the exploratory team comprised of Jack/Daniel/Teal'c/and Sam , go through the wormhole that instantly transports them to other planets ( this device is called the Stargate ) and they encounter new cultures or bad guys . Some episodes are on-world , meaning that they do not go through the Stargate once in the episode and rather deal with pressing issues on Earth . Through the years , you start to see a decline in the SG-1 team as close knit , and more character-building story lines . This , in turn means even more on-world episodes , which is perfectly understandable . My rating : 8.75/10 -- -- While most of this show is good , there are some instances of story lines not always getting wrapped up and less of an emphasis on gate travel these last few years . But still , top notch science fiction !
`` It 's all up to you , Ed ? '' `` Now you get to play the game . '' The day my father left my mother , he took me to see this film with his new girlfriend , on opening day at the Cinerama Dome in Hollywood . I was but fourteen years old . I was n't even entirely sure what I was seeing , but I will never forgot it , especially the scene with Ned Beatty . Watching it today , thirty-six years later , it still gives me quivers . My father was a huge Burt Reynolds fan , hence the reason for standing in line for almost an hour in to watch what was supposed to be an 'action movie . ' I had seen two films at the Dome prior to this : `` Grand Prix '' and `` The Song of Norway . '' Well this was n't exactly Mario Andretti or The Brady Bunch . After leaving the theater , I was shell-shocked . But even at that tender age , I appreciated the artistry ... and after seeing again today , am I surprised I was still standing after witnessing this highly disturbing , yet extremely well-crafted film . Suffice it to say it was a traumatic experience for a fourteen year-old that had yet to kiss his first girlfriend . I do n't blame my father for taking me , but it was a bit much for a child to witness . As an adult , I still find it quite disturbing , yet I am still very impressed with the quality of the film-making . Burt Reynolds as an absolute wonder , as are all the principles ... from Billy Redden as the inbred guitar wonder , to Ronny Cox as the terrified insurance salesman ... everyone does an admirable job . The sound quality is second to none , from the chirping birds to the ticking clocks . The photography , cinematography ... all the technical aspects of this remarkable film are first rate . The moral questions raised , from murdering the sexual assaulters to the aftermath of dealing with killing a human being , remain as profound today as they did when this groundbreaking film was released . And the classic sequences of attempting to survive in the wilderness after dealing with such unforeseen brutality are life-altering . These four men , city men , suddenly confronted with a situation with never imagined , raise the bar from action to horror . It 's a classic to be sure . And the phrase `` you have a pretty mouth '' has been quoted endlessly , from Saturday Night Live to off-the-cuff comments around water-cooler at work , this movie is without a doubt a huge part of our societal pop culture ... as much as `` Make my day '' or `` I 'll be back '' ever were . So what would YOU do if you found your friends being sexually assaulted at gunpoint by mountain men far away from your life in the city , cozy bed , wife and kids ? And if you took the measures Burt Reynolds did ( and I would have done the same ) would you bury the body beneath the soon-to-be-lake , or stand trial and take your chances ? The bottom line is : Deliverance delivers . You can take that to the bank . If this movie does n't get under your skin , then you are not human . Even if you have seen this before , rent it again and ask yourself the above question . My favorite part of the film remains the same : Ed failing to kill the deer ... then changing . Life and it 's unpredictable circumstance can change a man . And I suppose that 's what this film is all about Jon Voight , in particular , as Ed , gives the best performance here . And he remains one of the more gifted actors in Hollywood history , from Midnight Cowboy to his highly underrated performance as Franklin D. Roosevelt in Pearl Harbor , his acting lifts the movie to another level . Climbing the rocks at dusk , terrified and determined to make it right It needs to be seen to be believed . I guarantee your heart rate will elevated to a new level . Briskly paced , tense , taut and tightly drawn as a as a banjo string , this is a morality play that asks questions that remain today . Times have changes , but our choices as human beings have not . Ten out of ten stars .
Vampires , sexy guys , guns and some blood . Who could ask for more ? Moon Child delivers it all in one nicely packaged flick ! Gackt is the innocent Sho - who befriends a Vampire Kei ( HYDE ) , their relationship grows with time but as Sho ages , Kei 's immortality breaks his heart . It does n't help that they both fall in love with the same woman . The special effects are pretty good considering the small budget . It 's a touching story ripe with human emotions . You will laugh , cry , laugh , then cry some more . Even if you are not a fan of their music , SEE THIS FILM . It works great as a stand alone Vampire movie . 9 out of 10
I think this movie had to be fun to make it , for us it was fun to watch it . The actors look like they have a fun time . My girlfriends like the boy actors and my boyfriends like the girl actors . Not very much do we get to have crazy fun with a movie that is horror make . I see a lot of scary movies and i would watch this one all together once more , or more because we laugh together . If this actors make other scary movies i will watch them . The grander mad man thats chase to kill the actors is very much a good bad man . He make us laugh together the most . i would give this movie a high score if you ask me . I do n't know if the market has any more of the movies with the actors , but the main boy is cute . the actor with the grand chest has to be not real . they does n't look to real .
It 's really rare that you get an inside view at a media deception that has been so widely reported as official `` truth '' and caught so many `` news '' agencies with their pants down . This movie , in my view , deserves every price there is in journalism - it 's objective ( yes ! ) , courageous and a real `` scoop '' . It can do without comment , fake scenes or leading questions - everyone , including Chavez equally gets to make fools of themselves in their own words . The filmmakers `` only '' had to keep track of events and keep their cameras rolling . The Venezuelan elite teaches us `` How to depose of a President and sell it as a victory of democracy '' . It 's amazing that they lost in the end - so far . From what I know , the biggest TV station involved only got its terrestrial license revoked , they 're still broadcasting via cable and satellite . I highly doubt whether George W. or Barack Obama would be that tolerant after an attempted coup . But then , they do n't have to worry . The fact that the `` Chavez supporters shoot innocent civilians '' scam was so willingly repeated around the world reveals just how biased the so-called `` free '' ( established ) media really has become , or has always been , only more so . An important lesson to anyone interested in what `` really '' goes on in the world . The famous `` objectivity '' challenge always comes into play when journalists dare to oppose the mainstream view , or reveal unwelcome facts that accuse `` us '' - it has been true with the effects of the Atomic bomb , the US secret history of spreading `` democracy '' around the world or the Iraq war that , according to Johns Hopkins , has killed 1,3 million Iraquis by now , not to mention the 60,000 Afghans ( in 2003 ) that are never mentioned . To be objective , Saddam Hussein was less damaging to his people than the US . And the US is ready & willing to be more damaging to the Iranians that he was . I 'm quite curious about the upcoming trial of some Khmer Rouge leaders before the International Tribunal in The Hague , whether there will be any mention of `` our '' involvement in supporting and training Pol Pot 's guerrillas in the 80 's , when they had been largely defeated by the Vietnamese . Probably not . All the more reason to turn to the Independent media for balance , if not exposure of fraud .
Very rarely does Denzil Washington make a bad movie and come to think of it that goes for Kevin Kline and in this case , this must count as one of their best films . It is more about of film about how strong friendship can more than the story of Steve Biko although we do get an insight into what the man was like and how far the reporter and friend Donald Woods went to preserve the mans name and let the world know what a corrupt , putrid society South Africa was . The Direction is outstanding from David Attenborough as it was for Gandhi although if there is any critisism to be aimed it could be at the length of the film . Two and a half hours is a long time to sit through a historic movie .What is amazing is how he manages to control all the extras . Thousands of people in both films . This film really does open your eyes to what happened before the break up of Aparthiet and you can not fail to moved by it . 8 out of 10 .
I saw this film prior to joining the British Army . I went through my basic training , at first difficult and then as I progressed much easier . My time was spent during the height of the troubles in NI and the cold war . There was times when I questioned myself on what I had gotten myself into , not for long , as the training would always take over and you would always react instinctively . The voice over used to display what the soldiers are thinking is spot on , though I would have added breathing and heart rate as this seems to pound in your ear drums in given situations . Some years later I was in Canada for a family get together . An Aunty of mine who lives in the USA and is a lecturer at the Columbus Uni Ohio had done a paper on the effects of the British Army in NI . She spent some time out there researching . Although an ex pat she was very anti-British . She made a bee line for me and condemned me for being a British soldier . My only answer was see the film 'A long day 's dying ' . It 's the closest a civilian will get to realise why a soldier does what he does . The answer is right at the end .
Note : These comments are for people who have seen the movie . Vanilla Sky is a brilliant , complex , and thrilling movie that existentially explores exactly what the tag-line says : LoveHateDreamsLifeWorkPlayFriends . Maybe the movie plot can come into focus for confused movie-goers if one looks at it from a different angle . Considering the following : Now , I have not painstakingly gone through the film scene by scene , so I will have to further examine my assertions , ( and I welcome your thoughts ) but give this a try and see if the movie does n't fall into place : Where exactly does the debatable 'splice ' occur ? Now , I 'm not talking about the splice as it is explained by the L.E . 'technician ' , since that sequence itself could be actually interpreted as a rationalization inside of David Aames 's mind/dream/coma state , but the true splice between reality and dream . It seems to me that the reality of the car crash , the way that it is filmed ( no explosion , for example ) is a likely 'splice ' point , and that any particular sequence containing an existential/dream/coma/non-reality feel to it -- whether it 's shown onscreen before or after the crash -- is actually a part of Aames ' personal journey toward self-realization inside of his own mind . In that respect , then , we are left with two questions at the very end ( if you know of more , let me know ) : is Aames actually disfigured , and where does he wake up ? If you do n't get entirely wrapped up in the exact sequence of details in the plot , or at what particular point his dreams are scattered throughout , this movie becomes a fascinating exploration of a human on a journey to find himself and what that means in today 's pop-culture society .
Tian 's remake is no good at all . I only click on his remake documentary to see Wei Wei , the original actress back in the classic 1948 film say a few words to the crew . We are going to meet Wei Wei this Sunday ( 28/3/2010 ) after the showing of Xiao Cheng Zhi Chun in the Hong Kong Film Archiev . Wei Wei is almost 90 years old in silver hair , her cameo appearance in Hong Kong films is always a surprise to her fans . In this year 's Hong Kong Film Festival , a special program is dedicated to Fei Mu , director of this epic movie and Wei Wei 's still shot from the movie is being seen all around in Hong Kong . My son , who turns 21 this year , is surprised Wei Wei was so beautiful then .
One does n't get to enjoy this gem , the 1936 Invisible Ray , often . But no can forget it . The story is elegant . Karloff , austere and embittered in his Carpathian mountain retreat , is Janos Rukh , genius science who reads ancient beams of light to ascertain events in the great geological past particularly the crash of a potent radioactive meteor in Africa . Joining him is the ever-elegant Lugosi ( as a rare hero ) , who studies `` astro-chemistry . '' Frances Drake is the lovely , underused young wife ; Frank Lawton the romantic temptation ; and the divine Violet Kemble Cooper is Mother Rukh , in a performance worthy of Maria Ospenskya . The story moves swiftly in bold episodes , with special effects that are still handsome . It also contains some wonderful lines . One Rukh restores his mother 's sight , he asks , `` Mother , can you see , can you see ? '' `` Yes , I can see more clearly than ever . And what I see frightens me . '' Even better when mother Rukh says , `` He broke the first law of science . '' I am not alone among my acquaintance in having puzzled for many many years exactly what this first law of science is . This movie is definitely desert island material .
Probably the two main significances of `` Elmer 's Pet Rabbit '' are that the wacky leporid featured in `` A Wild Hare '' now has a name , and that he utters his famous `` Of course you realize this means war ! '' for the first time . Mostly , the Termite Terrace crowd was still trying to figure out what exactly to do with this long-eared rascal . It 's certainly a must-see for hard-core fans of this genre , but others will probably have little reason to take interest . But make no mistake , it 's quite hilarious what Bugs Bunny does to the eternally gullible Elmer Fudd . Clear shades of things to come abound throughout the cartoon . I recommend it .
I have not seen this movie ! At least not in its entirety . I have seen a few haunting clips which have left me gagging to see it all . One sequence remains in my memory to this day . A ( very convincing looking ) spacecraft is orbiting the dark side of the moon . The pilot releases a flash device in order to photograph the hidden surface below him . The moon flashes into visability . . . . and for a few seconds there it is . Parallel lines , squares , Could it be .. then the light fades and the brief glimse of ... what ... has gone and it is time for the spacecraft to return to Earth . Wonderful . I have seen some other clips too but would LOVE to obtain the full movie .
Rating `` 10/10 '' Master piece Some years ago , i heard Spielberg comment that he would redo the movie here and there if he had a chance . Well , Mr Spielberg , i guess nothing is perfect , but this movie - together with schindler 's List - is your best . Even Oprah acts well in this one ! What got me most is the realism of the story and drama . Stuff like this happened and is still happening in the world .
Diego Armando Maradona was , and still remains as the best football player , the game has offered . Not just an athlete , but an artist . This documetary if the 1986 World Cup will forever live in the memories of every football fan around the world . Because of his tremendous and unbelievable goal , which he scored against my own country ( england ) . There 's absolutely no point of diminishing this star . Although I dont undersand spanish , I can appreciate the argentine narrator . He actually cries of happiness , and can barely express his emotion ... .. Anything I wrote can be senseless and difficult to comprehend , but readers ... ..you have to watch this to know what I mean .
This movie was very good . If you are one who likes to watch horror movies , I recommend it . The acting was very good although I thought that the actress playing Julie could have had more emotion behind her lines . Allan was very good and I thought the cinematography was amazing . I was on the edge of my seat the entire time while my friends were freaking out and screaming . It was a complete success in my opinion and should have made it to the big screen . I give it two thumbs up ! I definitely would say that if you have n't already seen it then go rent it . If you have seen it and did n't like it go and watch it again because there are parts that were completely unreal . I also liked how a lot of the movie was filmed around and on my school 's campus .
I saw this movie after i saw Blue Crush and other of Michelle 's movies , i thought she had a bleak future in this business.I was extremely wrong after watching her performance in `` Girlfight '' i was amazed in the way she captures the emotion of one a fighter , but also a warrior.In this movie the way she confronts her father about the treatment of her and her brother , the way she conveys anger when getting hit.Her characters learning curve in the movie of she cant always put up a wall and hide from love , or that just because she has power she wont win.I believe this role was fit perfectly for Michelle even though she had no prior experience , the director saw talent , I criticize myself for not seeing the talent in her .
I doubt much of this film is based on a true story . At the beginning it says based on a true story , sort of . I bet the only truth to it was there was an ex-model turned bounty hunter possibly named Domino . Anyways , it begins with Domino talking to Lucy Liu , who works for the FBI . Domino is being interrogated about what she knows about a theft of 10 million dollars . Through flashbacks , we see Domino as a child , then as a model , and how she became interested in being a bounty hunter . She basically tells 2 other bounty hunters off , Ed and Choco . They let her join the group . She 's tough , can use any kind of weapon , and will use her good looks if needed . They get involved with a scam that Clarmont , a bailsman , has going . Along the way , the group starts a reality TV show , and that 's where Ian Zering and Brian Austin Green become involved . They are sort of like hosts and must have been really desperate to appear in this . I thought the story was entertaining and it had some laughs . The editing did n't bother me . There 's also a lot of violence , mainly using guns , and blood . It could have been a little shorter . FINAL VERDICT : Good enough to watch .
Now I love American Pie 1 and 2 while 3 was great just for Seann William Scott 's performance as Stifler but after that the quality has dropped . Band Camp kept the standard reasonably high with characters you actually cared about but Naked Mile was the same joke and plot- lines recycled ( Erik Stifler 's sex problem is like Jim 's ) . It had some amusing moments like the Football game against the midgets and the 'punishment ' of Coozeman but on the whole it lacked originality and the 'Mile ' was just stupid and moronic . Not to mention the irritating girlfriend who does n't want to have sex . Anyway enough about the Naked Mile . I watched Beta House with apprehension as I thought it could take the series to a new low but I was pleasantly surprised . To be honest there is no real plot but it 's filled with hot girls ( Ashley is incredible ) and sex jokes aplenty . Yes it is formulaic and the jokes are old but Dwight Stifler ( Steve Talley ) raises the bar with an exuberant performance . The Greek Olympiad is entertaining especially the penultimate and final events while Christopher McDonald 's cameo is hilarious . There are weak points though . Coozeman is as irritating as he was in the first , I 'm still baffled to as how he ever got a part . While Coozeman is bad Erik Stifler is worse . John White made Naked Mile a pain to watch but in Beta House he takes his performance to a whole new low . First and foremost he lacks charisma , a Stifler prerequisite . You really ca n't care less about him . The only reason I was bothered about his relationship was so Ashley could be on screen ! She shines above him as does the rest of the cast . Seriously John White is the ultimate in bad acting and has about as much charisma as a dead fish . Saying that the film does entertain and Coozeman 's fear that his girl is not exactly a girl is brilliantly funny . Overall this film is worth renting , get a few of your mates in and have a laugh at the vomit-fest event and vent your anger at Erik 'loser ' Stifler .
David Duchovny and Michelle Forbes play a young journalist couple who want to go to California , but ca n't really afford to , so they 'ride share '' with another young couple ( Brad Pitt and Juliette Lewis ) to save on expenses . The idea is for them to stop at various murder sites along the way , sites where serial killers did their thing , since Brian ( Duchovny ) is a writer and Carrie ( Forbes ) is his photographer . What they do n't know is that Pitt ( Earley ) and Lewis are serial killer and girlfriend who just goes along with whatever HE says . I do n't care for Pitt as a rule but he does justice to psycho roles . The scary thing is that he does them so well ; I 've actually KNOWN people like him before , no , not killers , but with pretty much the same mindset . Anyway , as the road trip goes along , Carrie guesses that the others are about out of money , but Earley seems to always come up with the cash somehow ... .never mind that he leaves someone dead here and there to do it though . Lewis does her role well , one that she excels at , a not-too-bright waif that has a good heart but does n't understand that she does n't have to put up with being beaten up by Earley when she does something he does n't like . As things begin to get more unacceptable Carrie insists that the other couple be put out at a gas station , and unfortunately it 's at that point where she 's inside that she sees a news bulletin that tells her exactly who they 've been ride-sharing with , after which things go downhill for them at a rapid clip . This is not the greatest flick in the world , but it 's not bad ... I watched what was supposed to be the 'unrated ' version but I wonder how much was cut out of the rated version , because this seemed fairly tame to me , really ... not that this makes it family fare or anything , unless it 's maybe the Manson Family . 7 out of 10 .
The first installment of this notorious horror series is presented as if it were a snuff film discovered by the producers and set up like an amateur camcorder tape , complete with a digital timer at the bottom of the frame . It presents a woman being kidnapped by a gang of black-clad men who torture her for several days before finally killing her . The hapless victim is beaten savagely and pelted with raw meat before having her fingernails pulled out with pliers , her hand smashed with a hammer , her eye punctured with a needle , and so forth . In the most nauseating scene , the woman 's captors burn her with hot water and drop live maggots into the burns . The series received a great deal of publicity when American actor Charlie Sheen , believing the series to contain actual murder , attempted to ban its distribution in the United States . An FBI investigation revealed that the films were only what they appeared to be to most viewers -- sick re-creations using nasty , but obvious special effects . Gruesomely staged by acclaimed Japanese comic-book artist Hideshi Hino , who also directed the third and fourth episodes , this film is a sure way to clear all but the most tolerant of rooms . But , gorehounds probably wo n't find anything special .
It is difficult to evaluate this or any other comparable film of the early sound era in terms that one might use for ordinary film commentary . At times there is almost a desperation , as many film personalities of the silent era try their wings at sound , surely fearing that they will be left by the wayside ( as did happen to some ) , Rin-Tin-Tin . however , was pertfectly natural . In such a vaudeville of unrelated sequences , some were sure to stand out John Barrymore 's soliloquy from Richard II is a moment certainly worth preserving . By and large , only those with earlier stage training exuded confidence . However , this is over all reasonably entertaining , and a must for `` film buffs '' especially interested in the silent to sound transition
I must admit , at first I was n't expecting anything good , at all . I was only expecting a cheesy movie promoting Gackt 's and Hyde 's image , but I 'm glad to say it has much more to offer . Yes , the acting is not that great , but it does n't suck either , all the cast 's well disciplined and they bring enough strength to their characters . Effects lack consistency but action scenes are satisfying enough . What really hooked me up was the essence of the storyline , although it merges fantastic elements , it also displays a crude reality . The developing of the characters , their doubts and their feelings really got on to me and I think that 's the key of this movie . It puts you to think and it does well transmitting all the angst . It fulfills any expectations for a good drama . I would definitely recommend it to everyone .
I went into The Straight Story expecting a sad/happy type drama with nice direction and some good acting . These I got . What I was n't expecting was an allegory for the trials of human existence . Leave it to Lynch to take a simple story about a 300 mile trip on a lawnmower and turn it into a microcosm for the human condition . If you did n't notice , watch it again , paying attention to the ages of the people Alvin meets , the terrain he 's driving through , the reactions people give him , the kinds of discussions he has ( one of the first is about pregnancy and children , one of the last is outside of a cemetery ) . The last road he drives down is particulary haunting in this context , as it narrows and his fear and nervousness mount . The last mechanical failure could be seen as a death , and the miraculous rebirth of his engine relating to an afterlife , in which he achieves the desired reunion . I only hope some of the people who branded this as a slow sappy melodrama take the time to watch with a more holistic attention .
The third Muppet movie is perhaps the most relaxed and pleasing , with the gang taking their modest college musical to the bright ( yet volatile ) lights of Broadway filled with typically naïve optimism . Of course , their first attempt fails and Kermit ( leader of the group and author of the show ) blows his top ; so , the others all go their separate ways so that he wo n't have to feel responsible for them . Kermit himself befriends a young wannabe fashion designer making ends meet by serving food at her father 's diner ( the old man , then , has a line in particularly tortuous non-sequiturs ! ) . We get the usual cameo appearances by a variety of stars : Art Carney ( as a producer ) , James Coco ( as an overzealous dog owner ) , Dabney Coleman ( as a confidence trickster ) , Elliott Gould ( who was also in THE MUPPET MOVIE [ 1979 ] ) , Gregory Hines , Liza Minnelli ( as herself  having her portrait at a classy restaurant replaced by Kermit 's , sporting fake moustache , as an ostensibly celebrated entrepreneur in a ruse to attract publicity to the Muppets ' show ) , Brooke Shields , and even director John Landis ( in possibly the film 's funniest scene as a Broadway producer before whom Kermit appears acting streetwise and chummy and hilariously donning shades and an Afro wig ! ) . The other Muppets more or less go through their typical paces , with ( regrettably ) less space given to Gonzo this time around ; while Miss Piggy is something of an acquired taste with me , the scenes in which the latter spies on what she takes to be Kermit 's romance with the waitress  and especially her violent reaction to this  are undeniably funny . What disappoints , however , is the climactic show itself ( after a fairly redundant midsection wherein Kermit gets amnesia and eventually picks up advertising on Madison Avenue ) which , rather than the expected splashy routines , procures nothing more original than the wedding ceremony of Kermit and his eternal flame Miss Piggy !
After `` Empire strikes back '' `` Return of the Jedi '' is my second favorite movie from the Star Wars series . Luke went to Tattoine to save Han Solo from Jabba . At the same time , the Galactic Empire is doing in secret , the construction of a new space station like the previous Death Star . If this station stays totally constructed , it will be the end of the Rebel Alliance . Both Vader and the Emperor are impatient because of the delay of the new Death Star , and they need to kill many of their commanders to have the project made in schedule . R2 and C3po are inside Jabba 's palace to send a message from Luke to Jabba , where Lukes pretends to negotiate Han 's life . He gives R2 and C3po as a gift to Jabba as part of his plan . Jabba does not accept the negotiation , since he is using Han Solo as a piece of his palace 's decoration . ( Han still is frozen in carbonite ) Lando is hidden as Jabba 's guard and Chewbacca is also gave to Jabba by a reward hunter . When the same Hunter tries to save Han solo and makes him stay in human form again , we see that is actually princess Leia in a disguise . The problem is that Jabba discovers Leia 's plan and takes her as his slave , while Han is thrown away in Chewbacca 's cell . Luke comes as a Jedi knight to rescue his friends . At his first try to kill Jabba , he falls into Jabba 's monster cell ( Bantha ) , but easily kills it . Jabba stays angry and decides to thrown Han , Chewbacca and Luke to Sarlacc , a big creature from the desert who stays 1.000 years digesting it 's 'food ' . Luke , Han and Chewie has success in scape again , and even Boba Fett dies when Han accidentally throws him in to Sarlacc 's mouth . Leia kills Jabba and goes after Han , Luke and Chewie as well c3po and R2 . Everybody 's safe again , Luke decides to go to Dagoba to complete his training as a Jedi , as well his promise to Yoda . The problem is that Yoda is too old and sick , since he already has 900 years old , and before he dies , Yoda says to Luke that he does not need more training , but to really be a Jedi , he must fight with Vader again . He confirms to Luke that Vader is Luke 's dad , and that there is another Skywalker besides Luke . In his last moments , Yoda asks to Luke to remember his advices about the temptation of the dark side , and to Luke transmit his Jedi knowledge to other people . When Yoda dies , Obi wan 's spirit shows up to Luke and tells him that Luke 's father killed his good side Anakin to become Darth Vader , and also that he is more machine than a man since he became a sith . Luke stays worried about killing his own dad , and says that he feels that his father still has kindness . Obi Wan tells Luke that his twin sister is Leia , and says the reasons why Luke and Leia were separated since babies . He gives his last advice to Luke saying that if he refuses to kill Vader , the emperor will win the war . At the same time , the Emperor says to Vader that he must give Luke to him when he shows up , since Luke is stronger than before , and they both needs to combine their efforts to bring Luke to the dark side . Now we are going to have one of the best battles from the star war series , when the Rebel Alliance plans to attack the new space station , the `` Death Star 2 '' , Luke will confront Vader and the Emperor , and Leia , Han and chewie needs to turn off the 'Death star 2 ' power field , with the help of the EWOKS . ( little creatures who looks little bears ) This is for sure one of the most exciting star wars of all !
As someone who lives near Buffalo , New York , this movie scored points with me before I even saw it , since the story is based here . There are even some bit parts with real-life news-TV anchor people from Buffalo..and , for once , it does n't knock the area . Hallelujah ! Theology-wise , puh-leeze ! ! ! God is still made to look and think like humans ... and , of course , be a bit on the liberal side . Being the lightweight comedy it is , it 's nothing that should win any awards but it still is entertaining and is a pleasant way to kill 102 minutes . There are some laugh-out-loud slapstick comedy scenes and , hopefully , audiences - from Christians to atheists.- got something out of this besides a few laughs , such as what prayer should really be all about . Kudos to the writers for at least getting that theology correct and giving a good message . Overall , it 's a good-hearted film that should offend very few .
I have always been a fan of David Lynch and with this film Lynch proved to critics that he has the talent , style , and artistic integrity to make films outside of the surreal aura that he 's become known for in the past decade . As much as the film is G-rated , it 's pure Lynch in style , pacing , and tone . The film moves at a masterfully hypnotic pace and is filled with scenes of genuine emotion and power . The cinematography is terrific , as is to be expected from a Lynch film , and the transitional montage sequences are breathtaking . It 's also very refreshing to see a film where the characters are all friendly , kindhearted folk and not unmotivated characters that are clearly labeled as being either `` good '' or `` evil '' . Richard Farnsworth turns in a beautiful performance as do the rest of the cast , most notably Sissy Spacek in an endearing performance as his daugher , and Harry Dean Stanton in a small but infinitely crucial role . With this film , David Lynch proved to critics that he could make a powerful moving motion picture just like he did in the 80 's with 'Blue Velvet ' and 'The Elephant Man ' . Critics seemed to lose faith in the past decade after he produced such surreal films as 'Twin Peaks : Fire Walk With Me ' and 'Lost Highway ' but with this film he showed that there was method to FWWM and LH , and it looks as if critics finally caught on with his recent film 'Mulholland Drive ' , considering the high praise it 's received and the Oscar nomination for Lynch . 'Straight Story ' is to me one of the most moving motion pictures I 've ever seen . It 's a loving story about family , friendship , and the kindness of strangers . I would highly recommend it .
This is one of my favorite movies of all time . I loved Rain Man with Dustin Hoffman and Tom Cruise . This movie is in some ways similar , but makes Rain Man seem artificial , shallow , unemotional , and trivial by comparison .
-A very pretty red headed woman waiting for her plane meets a charming young man that she connects with . As the two get on their flight and sit next to each other the young man Jack becomes deadly as he threatens Lisa to either change the room that a politician and his wife will be staying in , or else have her father die . See now that 's what you happens when you fly coach , stuff like that never happens in first class . -Other than having a conflict that takes place on a flight , the other thing that this movie shares with `` Flightplan '' is the sheer unbelievability *if that 's a word* of the story . The point of the whole is to get the main character to change a politician 's room so he can be assassinated which is a pretty plausible plan , but wo n't it have being easier for Jack to just find someone that was computer savvy and have them hack into the hotel 's system ? Teenagers today can damn near do anything with computers , so I 'm pretty sure it would have been easier for him to simply get someone to change it using a computer instead of going through the trouble of spying on Lisa and getting her into the predicament that she lands on in the movie . -Plus one thing that struck me as odd was how no one on the plan heard a single thing they were talking about . This is a very small plane were talking about here and since their voices were raised occasionally it seems to me like the other passengers should have heard something . But I 'm 100 % sure that I 'm reading way too much into it . The movie is meant to be as realistic as an episode of `` 24 '' so one ca n't be perplexed by such complexities . For all my complaints though , this is still a very fun movie that gets the job done . It 's not exactly the type that requires to shut of your brain , but at the same time it does n't require great intelligence to fully enjoy . -I 'd love to sit here in my comfy chair and rave about the brilliant acting in the movie but really I ca n't . I love Rachel McAdams , I love Cillian Murphy , and I like Brian Cox , but they do n't really stretch their acting muscles here . It 's not really much of a problem since this is n't the movie that studios hope to win multiple awards and the acting is n't the least bit horrible , just not great . Wes Craven is n't exactly the first that comes to mind when you think of a movie like this , but he does a very nice job considering the time they had to film the movie and the lack of depth to the script . It was definitely a huge improvement over the disappointing `` Cursed '' and as much as I liked him doing something different with this movie , I still would love for him to go back to doing what he did in the past which is great horror movies that is talked about decades after it 's release . -One nice thing about the movie which I really appreciated was just how short the movie was . It is great to sit and watch a nice three hour or so movie once in a while , but nowadays it 's like every movie that comes out feels too long , where as this movie just felt like the right length . Not too long , and too short . They do n't waste time by trying to develop the characters too much because they know this is n't the movie for that and by doing so they made a very nice short movie . Being a huge film music geek , I have to say that the best part of the movie is the ultra cool score by Marco Beltrami . It 's really nice to see Beltrami go from writing the predictable stuff to the great music he 's doing now . I really the cool techno/orchestral stuff he does for the main titles . Too bad that I ca n't find the soundtrack anywhere , would have really loved to listen to the titles anytime I wanted instead of having to pop in the DVD when I want to hear it . -Overall It 's nice for what it is and whiles it 's far from great cinema , should still provide for some small entertaining hour and a half
If you have n't already seen this movie of Mary-Kate and Ashley 's , then all I can say is : `` What Are You Waiting For ! ? '' . This is yet another terrific and wonderful movie by the fraternal twins that we all know and love so much ! It 's fun , romantic , exciting and absolutely breath-taking ( scenery-wise ) ! Of course ; as always , Mary-Kate and Ashley are the main scenery here anyway ! Would any true fan want it any other way ? Of course not ! Anyway ; it 's a great movie in every sense of the word , so if you have n't already seen it then you just have to now ! I mean right now too ! So what are you waiting for ? I promise that you wo n't be disappointed ! Sincerely , Rick Morris
Super Speedway makes a great demo of your new DVD / bigscreen / 5.1 channel sound system . The IMAX camera puts you right in the race car , where you cruise around various tracks at high speed , reminiscent of the driving sequences in Grand Prix ( if only that would appear on DVD ! ) . I enjoy watching it again and again . The only minus , and why I did n't give it a 10 , is some of the driving sequences look suspiciously like the film was speeded up . The soundtrack also requires a little suspension of disbelief - all you can hear in a real car is the engine . You wo n't hear swooshes as you go under bridges .
The title of this movie does n't make a lot of sense , until you see it in operation , because it 's the sound that a retarded young man makes while he 's operating his imaginary trolley , which is what he does all day . And he is just one of many odd characters in this surreal & at times , tragic tale of a group of slum-dwellers in Japan . There are two drunks who trade wives , there 's a man with aspirations to be a architect , and his young son who he sends out to beg for food . There 's a wise old man who seems to be the pillar of sanity within all that goes on around him , and there 's a businessman with some severe nervous tics that has a wife that treats him ( and everyone else ) like dirt . There 's no particular plot to this , really , it 's a bunch of stories that drift back & forth between each other , sometimes funny , sometimes tragic . All in all I thought it worked pretty well , & I had been dying to see this for a long time just based on its description . I was not in the least disappointed , and I 'd definitely recommend this . 9 out of 10 .
The most succinct way to describe Ride With The Devil is with but one word : authenticity . I will not rehash what has already been said about this wonderous film , but I would like to say how much the historical research and painstaking attention to detail the crew no doubt went through was appreciated by this filmgoer . As a student of history familiar with the period and setting of this film , I must say that this production is one of the most accurate fictional films regarding `` bleeding Kansas '' . Yes there were liberties taken on the actual events , as all fiction is apt to do . But the overall feel of the film is genuine . Authentic costumes , authentic attitudes ( no PC hindsight here ) even the actors look authentic.Even Jewel Kilcher ( who has a small part in the film ) looked like she stepped form a mid 19th century photograph . A few viewers I talked with have expressed their incredulity at the stylized dialog . They can not believe that 19th century farmers would `` talk like poets '' . What they do n't realize is that in this age of verbal slobbishness , the American public public of the 19th century was a surprisingly literate and eloquent bunch . These people were raised on Shakespeare and the King James version of the Bible . The screenwriters reconstructed the most likely verbal styles of these people , judging from documentation of the time . The stylized dialog just adds to the magical atmosphere of the film . But in addition to a historical document , this film works on a visceral level as well . Beautifully photographed and performed , it harkens back to the days of the great western epics . The raid on Lawrence , Kansas , done so many times before in so many other , lesser films is portrayed with a sense of urgency that puts the viewer right in the midst of the action . Romance , adventure , moral and ethical conflict.This film has everything a discerning moviegoer could want . In a year that was dominated by overhyped garbage like American Beauty , this great artwork was buried by an indifferent studio system . But I am certain that Ride With The Devil will be given it 's due in the coming years . Please rent this film . You will not be disappointed .
`` Footlight Parade '' is fascinating on so many levels . There is no way the supposedly staged `` theater prologues '' could have been produced in any theater on earth , of course . Think of the huge pools and three-story tall fountains for `` By A Waterfall , '' for instance . ( Berkeley directed John Garfield in `` They Made Me a Criminal '' six years later and had the Dead End Kids singing `` By a Waterfall '' as they took their showers . ) `` Shanghai Lil '' is the best production number in the picture . It 's a catalog of '30s Warner Bros. sensibilities . Note the African guys mixed into the scene with white and Asian prostitutes . You would never see blacks integrated into a social scene in other films of the period unless they were porters on a train or maids in a big house . Here the black guys are sitting at the bar and singing with the others . I also get a thrill when the military dancers do a `` card section '' presentation of Roosevelt 's image . There 's also the NRA eagle -- the logo of the controversial National Recovery Administration of the New Deal . FDR was the new president and hopes were so high that he 'd pull the nation out of the Depression . You 'd never see something so working class oriented coming out of MGM , of course . Warner Bros. wholeheartedly supported the uplift dictated by the F.D.R . administration . Dear little Miss Ruby Keeler was never better than she is playing the Chinese hooker , `` Lil . '' She hardly even watches her feet as she dances , which was one of her signature flaws . The Pre-Code stuff is fun . The `` By a Waterfall '' number is wonderful in that regard . The girls change into their bathing suits on the crowded bus speeding through Times Square with all its lights on . The spread-eagle girls swimming over the camera provide the kind of crotch shots that would not be seen for 35 years . In a few months the Production Code would eliminate such naughty pleasures .
Absolutely hilarious . John Waters ' tribute to the people he loves most ( Baltimoreans ) is a twisted little ditty with plenty to look at and laugh at . It 's like being turned loose in a museum of kitsch ! I have n't laughed so much in a theater since Serial Mom . I loved seeing old friends from the Dreamland days , Sharon Nisep and Susan Lowe , back in front of Waters ' camera . The cast is simply wonderful ( especially Edward Furlong and Martha Plimpton ) . Uses the best elements of past Waters atrocities ( especially the underrated Polyester ) and plenty of new surprises . Made me sick , in a wonderful way . Thanks , John !
I loved this film . Not being a swooning Ed Wood Jr. fan , I prefer to appreciate his `` boundless enthusiasm '' and acknowledge his shortcomings . His movies are fun , but his personal story is one racked with pain . I hoped , and was delighted to find , that this film would be about understanding his turbulent life , rather than simply heaping him with posthumous praise . From beginning to end , this film evolves from a documentary into a mythology , leaving the cast and the viewer unexpectedly connected to each other and to Ed Wood Jr. What we get are people who knew Ed Wood the best talking about him from all perspectives , positive and negative , and showing us their character as much as Ed 's . We get insight into Ed 's personal and professional life : from his romances , to his drinking , to his sexuality , to his friends , to his enemies , and even to his film making . The film itself is shot in a low-budget way that seems done out of respect for Ed , as if using the techniques of most theatrically released movies from 1996 would be disrespectful ( sort of like wearing a nicer suit than the President ) . The set designer uses a sense of humor and also a great deal of insight when matching each cast member with their background . Fans will be excited to hear personal testimony regarding Ed Wood controversies , and new comers will be amazed that this man was real . The DVD is full of impossible to find gems ( `` Crossroads of Lorado '' and photo galleries ) , but the real treasure of this film is the surprisingly engaging and interconnected story . Ed Wood had a habit of defining people through their association with him ( for better or worse ) , to the point where one woman will go down in history as `` Swimming Pool Owner '' for once letting him and his friends be baptized in her pool . This ability to define a person 's legacy comes through universally , as the most amazing effect of the film is to not only give a well rounded idea of the man that was Ed Wood Jr. , but also to give a comprehensive view of the community that he created . Somehow , without ever having more that one cast member being interviewed on screen at a time , the connection that Ed Wood created amongst the various people in his life becomes clear , and the viewer is left with great sense of involvement . Even the title hints at the B-list horror genre , but by the end , we see that even this is a kindness . What begins as unrelated stories by random people ends with the conclusion that all of the cast will be forever weaved into an unpredictably cohesive fabric that history will bring into haunting unity with Wood 's legend . In many ways a living contradiction , Ed Wood Jr. could not be condensed to a single viewpoint . This collaborative effort is the closest to knowing him that we can ever get . Being itself a juxtaposition of themes , it is at once respectful , provocative , thoughtful , gripping , fun , sad , kind , and fulfilling .
How powerful and captivating simple quality filmmaking can be . This film tells it 's tale with everyday scenes that manage to revel the poignancy hidden within . It 's true as others have stated , how this film really makes it glaringly obvious how lost Hollywood is in it 's special effects , overblown emotionalism and over the top climatic endings and have forgotten the essence of a meaningful story told with simple realism . So much of what these characters are going through is implied by the scene rather than spelled out in wordy dialogue . One aspect that I really enjoyed about the film was the contrast of the two brothers , one so very openly expressive in his childlike way and the other completely stoic but both able to evoke deep emotion . The older brother needed to say little , as he usually did , it was all there in that deadpan face of his ! Beautiful cinematography , wonderful acting , great direction ! Not to be missed !
Set during WWII , Bedknobs and Broomsticks is a fun-filled fantasy adventure for kids , starring Angela Lansbury as an apprentice witch who , with the help of three evacuee children and a 'Professor of Witchcraft ' , thwarts a Nazi invasion . Brilliantly inventive , with loads of laughs , this movie will delight kids of all ages with its great characters , exciting story and catchy tunes . Lansbury is perfect as Eglantine , the not-quite-perfect witch who takes the three children on the adventure of a lifetime , and her three young co-stars ( Cindy O'Callaghan , Roy Snart and Ian Weighill ) are equally impressive as the Cockney rascals who aid in battling the nasty Hun . The special effects are somewhat dated , but let 's face it , kids do n't care too much about these things , so long as they are entertained . And entertained , they will be . With some impressive scenes which brilliantly mix live action and animation to great effect , and more genuine movie magic than a hundred Harry Potters , it would be hard not to enjoy this wonderful slice of cinematic escapism . In fact , only a rather drawn-out musical number set in Portobello Road mars the film 's perfection , but with so much else to enjoy , that can easily be forgiven . And besides , any film featuring UK television legend Bruce Forsyth as a 'Flash ' Harry style spiv is guaranteed a good rating from me .
FORGET CREDIBILITY You must not expect credibility with action movies where the superhero has to perform an endless string of unbelievable feats , being trodden upon in the process but recovering at lightning speed , and transforming innocuous gadgets in lethal weapons ... especially when Renny Harlin is directing . `` CLIFFHANGER `` is no exception . But the movie has numerous assets : breathtaking scenery gorgeously photographed , stunning special and visual effects ( the first five minutes are gripping and give the tone of the film ) , excellent musical score , welcome attempts at levity to relieve some of the tension , and a solid cast : two heroes ( Stallone , star and cowriter , has the lion 's share of the footage , but the excellent Michael Rooker more than stands his ground ) , a charming heroin ( Janine Turner ) , and one of the most darstardy bunch of villains ever ( priceless John Lithgow and deceivingly feminine Caroline Goodall , but also Rex Linn - in a longer than usual part and who makes the most of it , Leon , Craig Fairbrass ) Good , solid entertainment then , if no credibility.As Roger Ebert wrote ( about another film ) '' It 's the kind of movie you can sit back and enjoy as long as you do n't make the mistake of thinking too much . ''
I havent seen that movie in 20 or more years but I remember the attack scene with the horses wearing gas-masks vividly , this scene ranks way up there with the best of them including the beach scene on Saving private Ryan , I recommend it strongly .
Barbra Streisand 's debut television special is still a pinnacle moment in entertainment history - in any media . Cleverly divided into three separate acts ( to minimize the interruption of commercial breaks ) , Streisand made the bold-yet-masterful decision to drop the typical variety show format of the time ( which is why there is no guest stars nor forced banter ) and carry the entire show on her shoulders alone . The risky move paid off enormously , as MY NAME IS BARBRA set a new standard for musical programming on television . Filmed in glorious black-and-white ( which actually adds to the effectiveness of the show ) , MY NAME IS BARBRA is flawlessly-conceived and impressively shot . However , what makes the show truly transcendent is Streisand herself . Watching the then-23 year old performer navigate herself through the show 's 55 minute runtime is nothing less than thrilling . She is in fantastic voice ( and even performs the entire first and third acts live ) , and gives first evidence of the immense star power that would soon follow her to the big screen . The special 's biggest asset is it 's boldness in allowing Streisand to simply stand on stage and sing some great songs . After the powerful opening performance of `` Much More '' ( with a brief opening snippet from Leonard Bernstein 's `` My Name Is Barbara '' ) , Barbra proceeds to wander through a multi-level studio set performing a frantic version of the Disney classic `` I 'm Late . '' In between verses of `` I 'm Late , '' Streisand stops at various levels of the set to sing some terrific numbers such as the haunting `` Make Believe '' and the thundering `` How Does the Wine Taste ? '' Halfway through the Act I , Barbra re-enters her own childhood to the strains of `` A Kid Again , '' and then gives highly energetic performances of `` I 'm Five '' and `` Sweet Zoo '' while romping among an over-sized set . The illusion is eventually shattered , however , as Streisand finds herself out of the fantasy and back in the real world . She then sings about this lost childhood innocence in the lovely `` Where Is the Wonder ? '' Streisand then dashes out onto a platform stage surrounded by an entire room-full of musicians and performs a rousing rendition of `` People '' before the thunderous applause of a live studio audience . Act II of the special begins with Streisand hamming it up for the studio audience with a campy rendition of `` I 've Got the Blues , '' before delivering a comedy monologue about `` Pearl from Istanbul . '' Streisand then heads off to Bergdorf Goodman 's department store , which allows her to sing a medley of poverty songs while parading around in some of the store 's elegant fashions . This segment is the brightest highlight of the special for many fans and critics . Some high points of the Act II medley include Streisand singing a restrained version of `` Second Hand Rose '' to the audience , appearing as a Latin bullfighter to the tune of `` Nobody Knows You When You 're Down and Out , '' and portraying a frustrated paperboy while mugging to `` Brother , Can You Spare a Dime . '' The third Act of the special is a straight concert , with no set pieces or concepts . Streisand is a performer who really thrives on the concert stage , and this segment is the most thrilling moment of the special . Streisand enters belting out an almost gravity-defying rendition of `` When the Sun Comes Out , '' and continues to amaze the viewer with a lovely version of THE YEARLING ballad `` Why Did I Choose You , '' a scorching performance of `` Lover Come Back to Me , '' and an impassioned medley of three songs form FUNNY GIRL . Streisand really outdoes herself , however , with a phenomenal rendition of the Fanny Brice/Billie Holiday standard `` My Man , '' which instantly became on of the singer 's best-loved signature songs . Streisand performs her immortal ballad version of `` Happy Days Are Here Again '' as the closing credits roll by on the left-hand side of the screen . The iconic finish to the number reaffirms to the viewer that he or she has indeed seen something truly special . MY NAME IS BARBRA was a huge rating triumph when first aired , and it eventually picked up five Emmy awards in addition to spawning two Top-Five , Gold-selling soundtrack albums . Watching it all again , it 's absolutely no surprise .
As others have commented , I checked this out after Siskel and Ebert listed this as one of their top 10 movies of the year . What a gift . I then went out to buy it , just so that I could loan it out . Best quote ? Dwight Yoakum stops his truck when he realizes that someone ( Cage ) is on top of his cab . When Cage peers down , he apologizes . `` I 'm sorry if I scared you . '' Yoakum thrusts his pistol in Cage 's face with `` Does THIS look like I 'm scared ? '' Great bit of humor after an exciting ( and temporary ) escape . There really was a sense of fun to this . The constant sighting of the `` Welcome to Red Rock '' sign elicits a groan and a smiling head shake . The music created a hunting , eerie quality to the film reminiscent of `` Twin Peaks '' . Unlike `` Twin Peaks '' , though , it does n't spoil things by going too far into the outlandish , needing to `` top '' itself . I admit watching the credits 15-20 times . You see , they had Yoakum 's `` Thousand Miles from Nowhere '' ( perfectly chosen ) playing as a freight train curved around down to the desert floor . . with snow-capped mountains in the distance . This was incredible , fluid framing . Further , I 've never seen a better unification of sight and sound on film . Also , it totally fit the story .
I f you thought Sam Mendes ' first film , the much heralded American BEAUTY was a movie with style to spare , wait until you see his highly anticipated second effort , the unrelentingly grim 30 's gangster melodrama ROAD TO PERDITION . Some critics have hailed this new movie as a worthy successor to THE GODFATHER , a rash judgment made by several reviewers taken with Mr. Mendes ' extraordinary technical prowess . If the mechanics of movie making are what make a picture great , then yes , ROAD TO PERDITION is a distant cousin to THE GODFATHER in terms of what it achieves in cinematography , editing , music scoring and sound . What it does n't have is a resonance that all great stories and some very rare movies have that stay with the viewer long after the experience of reading or seeing it is over . As with American BEAUTY , there is a cold , distancing feel to this movie , despite some very tense scenes involving paternal love , loyalty and betrayal . This story of a hit man ( Tom Hanks ) and his relationship to a surrogate father - figure who is also his boss , an elderly Irish mob leader ( Paul Newman ) , seems to have been culled from innumerable gangster movies of years past . The father /son motif that hangs over this picture is so heavy handed in its treatment that there is not much room for spontaneity ; the entire enterprise has been very carefully wrought , and nearly all the dialog is delivered with an air of great portent : this is obviously a gangster film , hence the requisite amount of violence and bloodshed , but the film is nearly devoid of any humor to speak of ; only in scenes involving a young boy driving a getaway car in a cunningly edited montage is there any sense of lightheartedness to leaven the pervasive sense of doom . That being said , I have nothing but the highest praise for the stunning look of this film ; indeed , it is not an overstatement to say that this is one of the most beautifully photographed and designed movies I have ever seen . Veteran cameraman Conrad Hall will very likely win another Oscar for his work here . The production 's sets and costumes are just as exemplary ; in fact , the entire film is a technical marvel . Mr. Mendes continues to astonish with his vivid use of color , and he and Mr. Hall again make very dramatic use of red blood splattered against pale colored walls , all the more effective and disconcerting due to the preponderance of blacks , blues and grays that dominate the movie 's color scheme . If I have failed to duly note the acting , it is not because the actors do not purport themselves ably ; everyone in the film is top notch , with special mention going to the two malevolent bad guys : Daniel Craig is the classic `` man you love to hate '' , the spoiled , impulsive son of Newman 's gangster father ; and an almost unrecognizable Jude Law as an especially slimy miscreant who goes on pursuit of Hanks and his son and figures very importantly in the film 's riveting second half . But acting in a movie this dazzling is bound to take a back seat to the photographic fireworks on display here . If a Rolls-Royce was a movie , I 've no doubt it would look like ROAD TO PERDITION .
Outside the household is a different world and the family struggle to tread the line between Dads authority and their hopes and dreams . The period is captured ; The bakelite light swithes , the Georgian floorpan , the picture rails , the wall paper , the short skirts , the cheeky lads , the Mini van , shiny modern mangles ... . The location is captured ; A wind lashed glacier hewn rocky landscape , walls of local stone , community , freedom . But there is much much more ; Childhood , happiness , sensuality , pride , values , freedom , authority , rebellion , violence ( in the deepest sense ) , love , struggle , puberty , naivety , morality , trust , faith , deceit , machismo , manners , maturity , loss , poverty , sacrifice , horror , acceptence , revelation , comedy and parenthood are all there . ( And in no particular order ! ) . This film is a richly woven expression of family tensions that are as relevent today as ever . The fact that some of these are n't tackled directly is testament in itself to the attitudes of the day but the fact that they are all here is a testament to the acting skill , the story and the direction . If there 's anything bad about this film , it 's that all this deeply entrenched and wonderfully enacted tension is swept away a little too lightly towards the end . Maybe I missunderstand - the doom and gloom felt by many teenagers really does disappear if they deal with it ( ** ) - maybe the film is trying to send even that message too - well worth doing . What is the film trying to say ? Kids : Parents were young too , parents struggle too , everyone makes mistakes , everyone learns , things change , struggle can end happily . Parents : Do n't try too hard ! Try to remember that your support is the key to their well being . It sounds simplistic does n't it ? Sometimes the film feels like that too but it 's then that you notice how much is being being challenged and uncovered . The film is a classic . ( ** ) - Not the problems themsleves .
**POSSIBLE SPOILERS** The biggest part of the movie that does n't work IS the Wendigo , and when your title character fails , your movie usually is n't far behind it . The filmmakers ' interpretation of the Wendigo 's form is interesting , and can be properly menacing when filmed correctly - when the fleeing killer sees the Wendigo in a flash in his rear view mirror , for instance - and the tree-form was actually very good . However , as a monster character it never really comes to life . We do n't get much of an explanation for its behavior , and what we DO see from it does n't jibe with either the story told in the movie itself , or any Wendigo lore I 've ever read . I think one of the main reasons that the monster fails is that it is n't given enough to do , in the movie . When you boil this film down to its bones , what you have is a suspense thriller with a little bit of a supernatural element , instead of a movie about a monster . The cinematography is good , though a little cheesy ; the filmmakers use scenery , lighting , and time of day to convey atmosphere and mood rather well . The character of Otis comes across as truly dangerous and unpredictable , making him the real monster in the film . It might have been more effective to explain his behavior as him being possessed by the hungry spirit of the Wendigo , which would also be a more accurate representation of the real legend . I have heard unconfirmed reports ( from a newsgroup ) that the reason the Wendigo does n't do much is that , when the monster suit was built , it wound up so heavy and and uncomfortable ( in order to mimic the stance of it standing on cloven hooves , the performer had to walk on his toes ) that it was nearly impossible to run , walk , or otherwise perform in it . Thus the many flashes of the creature standing still , and the obvious sped-up footage of it running . I stress that these reports are uncomfirmed .
This is a really interesting film . It 's the first time I have seen the relationship between an older woman and a younger guy on screen without it being sensationalist . For the director of Notting Hill this is a bold move to something serious
... when this movie so well proves that they indeed are unnecessary . Although few lines , it was kind of weird to see this movie , no subs , in a language unknown . A friend of mine sent a VHS , included a few pieces of papers with all lines translated to English . with her translation next to me , I began watching this tale ( it is indeed a tale ) , and from the very first tunes of the whistling melody during opening credits I was stuck . the colours , that minimal acting ( well , in most cases ) , absurd comedy , slapstick , thoughtful , beautiful ... along with a few other movies ( Paris , Texas and Nenette et Boni ) , this one is able to speak to anyone 's heart - without words . Whenever you get the chance , see it . Whatever you do - do n't miss it . It 's a once in a lifetime experience . Oh , acting is great , the soundtrack is brilliant , the story is simple and told a thousand times before - but rarely ( never ? ) like this .
This Showtime movie really deserves a far better viewer rating than a 4.5 ; I gave it a 10 based on the story and the acting of the two stars . After reading the viewer comments , I was surprised at how many folks expected this movie to be a comedy . Yeah , I see that IMDb lists it as Comedy/Drama under Genre . That sure is misleading , is n't it ? Fortunately , I saw the movie before logging onto this website so I did not have that expectation . In fact , based on the synopsis of what I heard , I fully expected it to simply be a Drama . I 'm wondering if disappoint at this not being a funny movie caused so many low votes . Another factor that might have caused low votes is that this movie is very much 'character-driven ' . 'Driving Miss Daisy ' is an example of another character-driven movie that comes to mind . Someone 's previous comment complained about a boring trial . Tom 's ( Danny Glover ) work scenes seemed to distract from the real plot of the movie . That is , how he was engineering the upward social climb of his family - or his personal troops , if you will . However , they served to establish credibility and justification as his right to move to Greenwich and move 'up ' in the world . Tom 's obsession became a compulsion . He proved that he would stop at nothing to blend into the white neighborhood . His chagrin when another black person moved next door was not due to skin color . It was because of everything the 'interloper ' represented ; everything that Tom had left behind . In essence , Tom had become an Oreo cookie : Black on the outside but White on the inside . The last 20 minutes of this movie are among the most powerfully written , directed and acted ( by Whoopi Goldberg ) I have ever had the pleasure to witness . I realized that the climax of the film was not the obvious event that happened next door ( do n't want to give it away ) . The climax is verbal and Whoopi delivers it . I am still not clear if it is the conversation when she informs Tom which college Tom -Two is going to or when she releases it , all in the middle of the night and Tom wakes up . Nevertheless , the denouement is great . You know that life on that street will never be the same . My favorite kind of character-driven flick : people go through problems , some pain , do their dance , they grow , they change , and life goes on . As an audience member , I may learn something or be inspired .
The 1st season was amazing , the whole idea of them adjusting to the island , while mysteries were being explored ( And seen ) was just phenomenal ; filled with suspense , tons of cliffhangers , and an amazing plot . I mean , I love the whole idea of just seeing them get used to the island . And then first seeing the smoke monster in the first episode really caught my attention . From then on , I was hooked The second season was right on par with the 1st season , only a little better . I absolutely loved the idea of the hatches and the DHARMA Initiative . The whole plot and sequences of season 2 were mysterious , creepy , and exciting . I loved all the suspense surround others on the island , but the DHARMA story really made season 2 amazing . Season 3 was n't quite as good as 1 and 2 ... but nonetheless , great . I loved seeing the back-stories of the others , seeing their camp , and seeing the mysteries further explored . ( `` Tricia Tanak Is Dead '' is one of my favorite episodes ) . This season , while not as good , was still breathtaking and fun , but most of all exciting ! Now , the 4th season . I had hopes for this season , and the 1st couple of episodes we 're good , but then it REALLY started to get boring and monotonous . I mean , I REALLY despise the new `` rescuers '' such as Miles and Daniel . The plot got old after the first couple episodes ... and MOST OF ALL ... . Season 4 was stripped away of something which made LOST a perfect series : The mystery , suspense , comedy mixed in ( Charlie gone ) and overall excitement . Also , some of my favorite characters have left .
Here is proof of why Mary Pickford was ` America 's Sweetheart . ' In this rather complex drama , Mary plays the young daughter of a squatter that dare to dream of a relationship with the son of one of the ` hill-toppers . ' The scenes where they steal a kiss and otherwise fall in love are simply delightful . She is even willing to take a bath . That Mary could pull this role off at the age of 30 is simply amazing and somewhat due to her diminutive stature ( 5 ' ) . Tess must face numerous physical and emotional challenges . She does so with spunk not seen in many heroines of the time . Tess packs a wallop and is not shy about fighting with anyone . Why she agrees to help the ` hill-topper ' daughter is beyond me , but she sacrifices her own happiness in order to keep a deep secret . Pickford 's close ups are wonderful . Danish-born Jean Hersholt is simply wonderful as the villain . The scene in which he manhandles a small baby is enough to make you throw vegetables ( or whatever ) at the movie screen . If Forrest Robinson ( who plays Daddy Skinner ) had worn a beard , he would have been a match for the model used in those World War I recruiting posters of Uncle Sam  Wants You ! Although the story is somewhat predictable and slow in the beginning , it is worth the investment in your time to see the piece or pure ` Americana . ' The film highlights choices available to us all involving making someone else happy and what it is to be a real Christian . Recommended .
Loosely based on the James J Corbett biography `` The Roar Of The Crowd '' , Gentleman Jim is a wonderfully breezy picture that perfectly encapsulates not only the rise of the pugilistic prancer that was Corbett , but also the wind of change as regards the sport of boxing circa the 1890s . The story follows Corbett { a perfectly casted Errol Flynn } from his humble beginnings as a bank teller in San Fransico , thru to a chance fight with an ex boxing champion that eventually leads to him fighting the fearsome heavyweight champion of the world , John L Sullivan { beefcake personified delightfully by Ward Bond } . Not all the fights are in the ring tho , and it 's all the spin off vignettes in Corbett 's life that makes this a grand entertaining picture . There are class issues to overcome here { perfectly played out as fellow club members pay to have him knocked down a peg or two } , and Corbett has to not only fight to get respect from his so called peers , but he must also overcome his ego as it grows as briskly as his reputation does . Along with the quite wonderful Corbett family , and all their stoic humorous support , Corbett 's journey is as enthralling as it is joyous , yet as brash and as bold as he is , he is a very likable character , and it 's a character that befits the tagged moniker he got of Gentleman Jim . The film never sags for one moment , and it 's a testament to director Raoul Walsh that although we are eagerly awaiting the final fight , the outer ring goings on are keeping us firmly entertained , not even the love interest sub plot hurts this picture { thank you Alexis Smith } . The fight sequences stand up really well , and they perfectly show just how Corbett became the champ he was , his brand of dancing rings round slugger fighters is now firmly placed in boxing history . As the final reel rolls we all come down to earth as an after fight meeting between Sullivan and Corbett puts all the brutality into context , and it 's here where humility and humbleness becomes the outright winner , and as far as this viewer goes ... ... ... ... ..it will do for me to be sure to be sure , 9/10 for a truly wonderful picture .
There is this private campground in Plymouth , Massachusetts , that 's been around since 1959 . My grandparents were among its founders , my parents had a site starting in 1965 , and my two brothers have sites there now . ( This does n't have anything directly to do with the movie ; bear with me . ) I spent summers at Blueberry Hill from when I was five years old to when I was eighteen , and it is to people like me to whom this film speaks : the ones for whom a group camp in the woods was , as my fiancée tells of me , `` the good and happy place . '' If you 've never experienced the lifestyle , Indian Summer will probably be lost on you ; do n't bother . It 's not quick-paced , it does n't have rapid cuts , the plots are n't in the least bit convoluted , it has no explosions , such dramatic tension as exists is mild , there are n't any A-list actors , there are no rapid-fire quips just to show off how clever the scriptwriters are ( other than , perhaps , Kimberley Williams ' killer line about how her fiancé should n't `` overwind his toys . '' That is not the least degree what this movie is about , any more than The Godfather is a slasher flick just because it has a lot of on screen gore . But Indian Summer is Godfather 's polar opposite . If you have experienced the lifestyle , see this movie . Do n't read any more , just do it . For me , this is a 9/10 film .
I really enjoyed this movie.I was fifteen when this movie came out and I could relate . This will be a movie I would show my kids to let them know , the feelings they are having are normal . It is funny to see how we could be so devestated by things at such a young age..who knew that we would bounce back ... .again and again ... .Great movie ! ! ! !
Well , I 'd heard from somewhere that Ossessione is a precursor to the Italian film genre , and particular favourite of mine , the 'Giallo ' ... but actually , aside from the fact that this is a thriller that was made in Italy ; the two have pretty much no relation . In the sixties and seventies , Italian film-makers would get themselves a reputation for ripping off just about every successful American film released . They 've not done that here , but Ossessione does follow almost the exact same story as the later American film 'The Postman Always Rings Twice ' , without giving the book 's author , James M. Cain , so much as a credit ! Anyway , the plot focuses on Gino Costa , a handsome drifter who , by chance , stumbles upon a café where a woman named Giovanna Bragana works . He soon learns that she 's married to Giuseppe ; a big fat annoying man , whom Giovanna ca n't stand to have even touching her . He wants the pair of them to run away together , but she 's not so keen on the idea . However , fate ends up intervening and her plan to have her husband murdered is successful ... Despite the fact that the film loses some credibility for not crediting the author whose story it 's based on , it has to be said that director Luchino Visconti implements the film noir style well , and in a way I even prefer the atmosphere of this film to some of the bigger American noir classics . The story is , as you would expect , extremely strong and the Visconti manages to pull good performances out of his cast . Visconti drags the film out a little bit too much , however , and with a running time of almost 135 minutes , I felt that the story was too thin to warrant this kind of length . I almost feel guilty for levelling all this criticism at Ossessione as it IS a good film , but it 's not a 'great ' film . The relationship between the two central characters is never really explored properly , and it seems like the film is keener to distract us from it rather than let us into the characters ' heads . There 's not much mystery to the plot as we pretty much always know what 's going on , and by not always focusing on the characters themselves ; the film is not as interesting as it could have been . Still , it makes for an interesting viewing and comes recommended for that reason ... although it 's not as good as the 1946 version of the same James M. Cain classic .
This is a refreshing , enjoyable movie . If you enjoyed , `` Four Weddings and A Funeral '' , `` Peter 's Friends '' , etc. , you will see a number of familiar and talented actors . Made me laugh , made me sad . I view movies for entertainment , and English-set movies generally fit that bill for me . Enjoy !
It 's a great American martial arts movie . The fighting scenes were pretty impressive for American movie made in 90 's . Of course the fighting scenes are n't that good as in Honk Kong movies , actually only few American movies have fighting scenes which are as good as in Honk Kong movies , even nowadays . When you watch American martial arts movie , you are expecting to see less impressive fighting scenes , but still having some nice moves , which can be surprisingly good sometimes , or at least that 's what I 'm expecting from these movies . I was impressed by this film . Some fighting scenes were really impressive , the acting , direction and the plot were good enough , so it 's a really worth watching movie , if you like American martial arts films of the 90 's .
Hello , this little film is interesting especially for an artist , film-maker or music creator or a visual artist , for : One can feel and examine David 's touch/style straight out of a short piece of relative simplicity . You can see the rhythmic spacing of the shots , the pans and the sound elements . Even as simple film , this creation is multy-layer . For example , there are some sounds that drone all along , while others appear ( though subtle ) , at certain points to support certain shots . One can see also several types of pans : some go up and down in a gentle back-forth way . There is diagonal pan . Zooms also go back and forth sometimes . The lightning and the composition/disposition of elements in the space is , as usual and obviously , work of a painer/artist . This can be felt even in this crappy room . This is to say : one can make exquisite art already by the simple art of placing the look/view and composing the scene . Then comes the forcelines of the visuals : like digonales , parallels , etc . The light 's degradées and the colours , although without too much research for textures as in big productions , are fine too . This is an artist 's sketch of a sort ... All this is not calculated but done with inner feeling and this feel gives the David 's touch/feel to it , as with any true artist .
This movie is a little unusual in that it 's got a very slim plot and the movie itself is done at a very slow and leisurely pace . While this makes it pretty different from the average Grant film , it is still highly watchable and entertaining . It 's sort of like someone said `` let 's just follow Cary around and watch as he gets perturbed at all the little problems that come up when you are having a house rehabbed '' . Considering what a fun actor he is in the film and the great support he gets from Myrna Loy and Melvin Douglas , the film works very well . While the film has pretty modest pretensions , it makes the most of the material . It 's a great film for Cary Grant fans or for the whole family .
One must admit , that Dev has an eye for beauty and talent . He gave a break to Zeenat Aman , a successful model , and also former winner of beauty pageant 's title , by casting her in a role , which was tailor-made for her debut . Her bespectacled , stoned look , and her swaying at the hypnotizing music , made her an instant darling of the viewers . This movie is a treat to the eyes , with it 's scenic locales , ethnic people , those Buddha temples , and chirpy , naughty Mumtaz , who looks quite attractive , in her ethnic wear , and dancing skills . Dev is of course , adorable , and this is one of his commercially successful performance . Hare Rama manages to keep the interest going , with it 's carefully written script , editing , and captivating music . Like Des Pardes , his another movie , Anand has handled the topic of youngsters falling in the habit of drug addiction , and the theory of them coming from disturbed families , and troubled childhood , is quite plausible . A good entertainer , this movie retains it 's freshness till date !
Red Rock West is one of those rare films that keeps you guessing the entire time as to what will happen next . Nicolas Cage is mistaken for a contract killer as he enters a small town trying to find work . Dennis Hopper is the bad guy and no one plays them better . Look for a brief appearance by country singing star Dwight Yoakam . This is a serious drama most of the time but there are some lighter moments . What matters is that you will enjoy this low budget but high quality effort !
And that goes especially for lawyers & cops . Puerto Rico , which boasts of a small , but potent film production firm , brings this multi layered tale of corruption , due to the on going drug cartel that starts in South America , makes a pit stop on the island commonwealth , and then northbound into North America . Steven Bauer , the most recognizable face on screen here , leads a cast of top notch actors , in a story of `` can you spot the only respectable face in the crowd ? '' . Ricardo Mendez Matta moves up from directing mainly action adventure fare for American television , in a screenplay written by Matta , along with Poli Marichal . The rest of the cast ( Elpidia Carrillo , Magda Rivera , Jose Herredia , Luz Maria Randon , to mention a few ) turn in oh so fine roles , in a film that will keep you wondering `` is there any respectable characters here ? '' . Spoken in Spanish with English subtitles . Rated 'R ' by the MPAA , this film contains outbursts of vulgar language , brief flashes of nudity , adult content & violence , some of which is quite lurid .
Eddie Murphy is one of the funniest comedians ever - probably THE funniest . Delirious is the best stand-up comedy I 've ever seen and it is a must-have for anyone who loves a good laugh ! ! I 've watched this movie hundreds of times and every time I see it - I still have side-splitting fun . This is definitely one for your video library . I guarantee that you will have to watch it several times in order to hear all the jokes because you will be laughing so much - that you will miss half of them ! Delirious is hilarious ! Although there are a lot of funny comedians out there - after watching this stand-up comedy , most of them will seem like second-class citizens . If you have never seen it - get it , watch it - and you will love it ! ! It will make you holler ! ! ! : - )
First I would like to say how great this . It is astounding and sometimes shocking . And to say the least I 'm 11 years old and this is my favorite movie , I can definitely stand a boring film , but this is anything but boring . It is like a trip through humanity . Its stark realism shows through this monumental masterpiece . It is a heart wrenching tale of two down and outers ( VOIGHT AND Hoffman ) who build a mutual friendship . Joe Buck ( VOIGHT ) a naive Texan stud comes to New York to make it rich by entertaining women . Soon he meets Rico 'RATSO ' Rizzo ( HOFFMAN ) , who is a poor man barely being able to pay rent . Ratso becomes Joe 's 'manager ' but soon both men ca n't find Joe a job which results in stealing food . As they try and survive on the streets of New York we realize how tough it is . They ca n't get Joe a girl until they meet a lady at a party . Joe makes some money and soon Joe takes Ratso on a Ratso 's dream spot , Florida . The final five minutes are heart breaking yet some of the greatest moments in the film . From MIDNIGHT COWBOY we get a stark and sometimes disturbing urban view on life .
This is really a great unknown movie.Perfect dialogue without the typical clichés.This movie relied on the actor 's talent and it was pulled off.It even had a little bit a comedy in it , but it was n't overdone.Once in the Life is what a crime drama is supposed to be , not the typical special affects garbage with sex thrown in.I especially loved the interracial aspects of it all . Now onto the actors themselves . Laurence Fishburne was superb at playing a career petty criminal.It 's a shame that he 's only allowed to show his talent in his own movie . Titus Welliver was fabulous as Fishburne 's junky half-brother . Eamonn Walker added flavor to the already perfectly spiced film . Paul Calderon was perfect as a grease monkey/drug lord.I loved his acting since `` King of New York '' . But the best acting in this film came from Gregory Hines and Michael Paul Chan , who were paired perfectly as two of Calderon 's henchmen . Once in the Life is for sure a keeper . ****1/2* out of ***** .
The plot is tight . The acting is flawless . The directing , script , scenery , casting are all well done . I watch this movie frequently , though I do n't know what it is about the whole thing that grabs me . See it and drop me a line if you can figure out why I like it so much .
Few movies can be viewed almost 60 years later , yet remain as engrossing as this one . Technological advances have not dated this classic love story . Special effects used are remarkable for a 1946 movie . The acting is superb . David Niven , Kim Hunter and especially Roger Livesey do an outstanding job . The use of Black and White / Color adds to the creative nature of the movie . It has n't been seen on television for 20 years so few people are even aware of its existence . It is my favorite movie of all time . Waiting and hoping for the DVD release of this movie for so many years is , in itself , `` A Matter of Life and Death '' .
this movie is awesome . sort of . it dosent really say much , or do much , but it is an awesome movie to watch because of how stupid it is . the high school is taken over by evil ms.togar that hates the one thing that all the students love , rock & roll . riff randle get everyone tickets for the ramones show , and this movie peaks with a take over of the school led my riff randle & the ramones . this movie has everything , a bad script , questionable directing , bad actors ( ie clint howard & p.j . soles ) , an awesome soundtrack , extreme campyness , these elements & much more come together to make this what it is , a classic . note - during the live ramones set , notice that darby crash of the germs is in the front of the crowd . neat-o .
From very long , we are seeing movies on Gandhi . And mostly , the light is always on portrayal of Gandhi as freedom fighter or man with principles . But when I heard that a movie is being made which will highlight Gandhi as Father and stress on his relationship with his Son , it instantly hit my attention as this is one territory which is least being explored as it has his own dark side and less people shown courage to dwell into it . Fortunetly , Anil Kapoor ( Producer ) and Feroz Abbad Khan ( Director ) did . The story start with Gandhi working in South Africa and his relationship with white people and his wife . Latter Akshay ( Harilal ) joined his father for becoming a barrister but his dream took overturn when his father ( Gandhi ) pushed ( Or motivate ) him to become freedom fighter . It showcase that Gandhi believes more on practical study rather then formal education . Harilal too try to walk on his father footstep but soon failed as its infatuation towards his wife , children and his own dream of becoming big success altered his path and then start the repulsion between son and father . He finally defeated his father in terms of pursuing his dream and to left him on his own terms . He written back to India but then start his unsuccessful stories which become bigger and bigger with time . I am leaving reader to see movie to catch further story ... Performance . First Akshay . He has given best performance of his tenure so far and is absolutely convincing in his portrayal as Harilal Gandhi . The scene in which he reach the room where his wife dead body is placed is one where you can see a fine actor which is hidden/developing in Akshay . Darshan jariwala is also good as MK Gandhi and able to live up such a larger then life character . He performed well and with quite an ease . Shefali Chaya ( Now Shah ) as Kasturba is brilliant actress and already proved her metal in TV serials . Bhumika chawla too performed well but actress of her candidature is waste in these kinds of role . Other actor have also justifies their performances . Technique and Make up is also good and cinematography especially that Duo tone color picturisation was too good . Costume looks and match with context . Overall , a worth seeing movie which is defiantly slow in progress and impatient people may find it boring but give you an insight of area which is not brought to silver screen till date . Also , the way story progress and connection of scene may look worn to some people and to critics especially but for an average movie watcher like me , it still enough to make me occupied on my seat till end .
one of the best low budget movies from Germany ! is this is the dark side of new age ? if you believe in esoteric , please do n't watch this movie ! it blows all your positive fantasies away . this movie shows that beyond the peaceful façade of spiritual soul searching lies a world of extreme transgressions and terror . i hope there will be a 35 mm copy soon ! Andreas Marschall 's first film is just the beginning of a new area , making movies with a few euros ! i 'm waiting for the second hit !
... about the importance of being young , having friends , and most of all enjoying life . Through the experience of four friends , Ligabue shows to the audience how life was back in the 70 's in a small italian village . the four carachters represent the four different aspects of human behavior ; also the drug experience is well represented .
The effects of job related stress and the pressures born of a moral dilemma that pits conscience against the obligations of a family business ( albeit a unique one ) all brought to a head by -- or perhaps the catalyst of -- a midlife crisis , are examined in the dark and absorbing drama , ` Panic , ' written and directed by Henry Bromell , and starring William H. Macy and Donald Sutherland . It 's a telling look at how indecision and denial can bring about the internal strife and misery that ultimately leads to apathy and that moment of truth when the conflict must , of necessity , at last be resolved . Alex ( Macy ) is tired ; he has a loving wife , Martha ( Tracey Ullman ) , a precocious six-year-old son , Sammy ( David Dorfman ) , a mail order business he runs out of the house , as well as his main source of income , the ` family ' business he shares with his father , Michael ( Sutherland ) , and his mother , Deidre ( Barbara Bain ) . But he 's empty ; years of plying this particular trade have left him numb and detached , putting him in a mental state that has driven him to see a psychologist , Dr. Josh Parks ( John Ritter ) . And to make matters worse ( or maybe better , depending upon perspective ) , in Dr . Parks ' waiting room he meets a young woman , Sarah Cassidy ( Neve Campbell ) , whose presence alone makes him feel alive for the first time since he can remember . She quickly becomes another brick in the wall of the moral conflict his job has visited upon him , as in the days after their meeting he simply can not stop thinking about her . His whole life , it seems , has become a ` situation ' -- one from which he is seemingly unable to successfully extirpate himself without hurting the ones he loves . He can deny his age and the fact that he has , indeed , slipped into a genuine midlife crisis , but he is about to discover that the problems he is facing are simply not going to go away on their own . He 's at a crossroads , and he 's going to have to decide which way to go . And he 's going to have to do it very soon . From a concept that is intrinsically interesting , Bromell has fashioned an engrossing character study that is insightful and incisive , and he presents it is a way that allows for moments of reflection that enable the audience to empathize and understand what Alex is going through . He makes it very clear that there are no simple answers , that in real life there is no easy way out . His characters are well defined and very real people who represent the diversity found in life and , moreover , within any given family unit . The film resoundingly implies that the sins of the father are irrefutably passed on to the progeny , with irrevocable consequences and effects . When you 're growing up , you accept your personal environment as being that of the world at large ; and often it is years into adulthood that one may begin to realize and understand that there are actually moral parameters established by every individual who walks upon the planet , and that the ones set by the father may not be conducive to the tenets of the son . And it is at that point that Alex finds himself as the story unfolds ; ergo , the midlife crisis , or more specifically , the crisis of conscience from which he can not escape . It 's a powerful message , succinctly and subtly conveyed by Bromell , with the help of some outstanding performances from his actors . For some time , William H. Macy has been one of the premiere character actors in the business , creating such diverse characters as Quiz Kid Donnie Smith in ` Magnolia , ' The Shoveler in ` Mystery Men ' and Jerry Lundegaard in ` Fargo . ' And that 's just a sampling of his many achievements . At one point in this film , Sarah mentions Alex 's ` sad eyes , ' and it 's a very telling comment , as therein lies the strength of Macy 's performance here , his ability to convey very real emotion in an understated , believable way that expresses all of the inner turmoil he is experiencing . Consider the scene in which he is lying awake in bed , staring off into the darkness ; in that one restless moment it is clear that he is grappling , not only with his immediate situation , but with everything in his life that has brought him , finally , to this point . In that scene you find the sum total of a life of guilt , confusion and uncertainty , all of which have been successfully suppressed until now ; all the things that have always been at the core of Alex 's life , only now gradually breaking through his defense mechanisms and finally surfacing , demanding confrontation and resolution . It 's a complex character created and delivered by Macy with an absolute precision that makes Alex truly memorable . It 's a character to whom anyone who has ever faced a situation of seemingly insurmountable odds will be able to relate . It 's a terrific piece of work by one of the finest actors around . Sutherland is extremely effective , as well ; his Michael is despicably sinister in a way that is so real it 's chilling . It 's frightening , in fact , to consider that there are such people actually walking the earth . This is not some pulp fiction or James Bond type villain , but a true personification of evil , hiding behind an outward appearance that is so normal he could be the guy next door , which is what makes it all the more disconcerting . And Sutherland brings it all to life brilliantly , with a great performance . Neve Campbell looks the part of Sarah , but her performance ( as is the usual case with her ) seems somewhat pretentious , although her affected demeanor here just happens to fit the character and is actually a positive aspect of the film . If only she would occasionally turn her energies inward , it would make a tremendous difference in the way she presents her characters . ` Panic , ' however , is one of her best efforts ; a powerful film that , in the end , is a journey well worth taking . 9/10 .
Too bad a couple of comments before me do n't know the facts of this case . It is based on actual events , a highly publicized disappearance and murder case taking place in the Wilmington , DE/Philadelphia PA region from '96 through 2000 . I have to admit I was highly skeptical of how Hollywood would dramatize the actual history and events and was actually quite impressed on how close they stayed to what was constantly reported on local newscasts and Philadelphia Inquirer news stories throughout the time period . Of course I immediately pointed out that the actress ( who I really like in Cold Case ) who played Fahey looked nothing like her ( Anne Marie was actually prettier ) . I have to admit though that Mark Harmon really nailed the type of personality that was revealed as Capano 's and the behavior that Capano exhibited throughout this period . Details of the case were right on ... no deviations of dramatic effect ... even down to the carpet , gun , furniture , and cooler . In conclusion , I also wanted to add that I have met Tom Carper many times at various functions ( a good man , despite being a politician ) and I am so glad that he pulled the strings in the Federal realm necessary to solve this heinous crime . Guys like Capano are real and it was great to see him finally put behind bars .

I 'd love to give Kolchak a higher rating but the show quickly went from scary/suspenseful to silly . ABC 's fault . They moved the show to Friday nights at 8:00 p.m. , then known as the `` family hour '' . Never should have been on Fridays in the first place . I was a sophomore in high school and loved the early episodes ! It was first up against Police Woman on NBC . ABC had huge problems with Friday nights . Bad season for them overall until Barney Miller , Baretta , and SWAT debuted in January of '75 . Kolchak should have been a hit . Darren McGavin begged to get out of his contract to end the show . Too bad the writing was n't up to Richard Matheson 's in the original TV movies . Still , McGavin made Kolchak his own , as actors can do . Jackie Gleason as Ralph Kramden and Caroll O'Connor as Archie Bunker come to mind . That INS set with the manual typewriters and clacking teletypes seems quaint and ancient today , yet that was part of the appeal . They were very lucky to have Simon Oakland reprise `` Vincenzo '' from the TV films .
Excellent pirate entertainment ! It has all the good ingredients to keep one 's attention -- an absorbing tale of intrigue , a fiery lady pirate named Spitfire Stevens ( Maureen O'Hara ) who 's attracted to the irresistible Mr. Hawke ( Errol Flynn ) who is out on a secret mission of his own . They make a fine romantic pair onscreen -- sigh ! Anthony Quinn is the mean , bad pirate weaving his villainous web of divide and conquer . I noticed the very familiar face of Mildred Natwick playing a supporting role as Mrs. MacGregor , the protector of young Princess Patma ( Alice Kelley ) . There is beautifully filmed scenery of shorelines , ships , and the bay . Lots of action too of sword fighting clashes , ship battles , daring leaps of Errol Flynn ( Robin Hood on board ship ! ) . From the flaming redhead herself I once heard in an interview of Maureen O'Hara that she boasted great command of the bullwhip and could also outdo Flynn in sword fighting in those days but there 'd be no need to put it to the test here . Very enjoyable movie .
Barman directed Any Way the Wind Blows as he would sing a dEUS song . Anarchy rules over a logical and common strain of thoughts . The story behind this movie just goes any which way the wind blows . And that can truly be refreshing to watch , if you are prepared and willing that is . Viewers who state that there is nothing to keep the story-lines together are right . Who the hell is that Windman anyway ? Still , I really enjoyed this movie . Antwerp is a beautiful , bustling , happening place and Any Way captures that feeling . It also captures the silliness , the racism , the bureaucracy , the addictions and the violence that survives undetected in a seemingly friendly city . The movie is entertaining , funny and a little shallow . Barman 's screen debut will not make as heavy an impact as his music debut . In that light some might be disappointed . But then again , 'Worst Case Scenario ' would be a subtle subtitle for Any Way the Wind Blows .
This film is a complete re-imagining of Romeo and Juliet in Tel Aviv and Nablus . The lovers are one from Tel Aviv et the other from Nablus . There is a border between them , and a constant state of war with the Israeli army ever present everywhere and the Palestinian militants everywhere else with their bombs . The situation is bleak enough . We can imagine love in that enormous loveless trap . But the film goes several light years further by imagining the two lovers are gay , Noam from Tel Aviv and Ashraf from Nablus . To be gay is accepted in Tel Aviv . It is off limits in Nablus . The conflict between the two peoples , the two communities is thus doubled with a conflict between two cultures , two ethics . But this could even be livable if the war did not bring some extra dimension . Ashraf 's sister is going to get married to a militant activist in Nablus . Ashraf finally tells his sister about his being gay . She can not accept it but accepts to speak about it later . From the wedding itself the newly married husband sends a commando into Tel Aviv to set up a bomb attack . It takes place in a café in Tel Aviv and one friend of Noam 's is severely wounded . Bad enough . The Isareli army sends a commando to Nablus to arrest the person responsible for this attack , but it turns sour and the newly married wife is shot dead in the street . The funeral follows the wedding . The husband and widower volunteers for a suicide bomb attack . Ashraf volunteers to take his place . The exiled lover comes back to Tel Aviv to die and kill a few people to avenge his sister . He arrives at a diner managed by some friends of Noam 's . But Noam sees him and gets out to speak to him . Ashraf has moved back to the middle of the street and he detonates his bomb when Noam reaches him in the street . The vengeance reunites the two lovers in death . We thus have the dual conflict but we do not have the Prince of Verona , a neutral character that can impose peace , or even worse the Prince seems to have chosen sides and to be on the side of Israel . The game is entirely false and death is sure on both sides . But the dimension of impossible love is all the stronger because it is redoubled by a play in the film , a play that shows love in Auschwitz , between two prisoners , one wearing a yellow star and the other a pink triangle . This is both strikingly strong and breathtakingly shocking : gay love in Auschwitz . What comes out of the film is that over there in Tel Aviv or Nablus love is impossible . The film is thus a denunciation of the conflict in Palestine that can not but continue though it has no reason to even exist though it has thousands of reasons to go on . We should never have let Great Britain deal with the region a long time ago . Today we have to find a solution in which no one will be humiliated . This will only be able to succeed if everyone comes together in order to find a lasting solution . But so far everyone is trying to avoid that general confrontation and discussion preferring bilateral manipulations . So suffering will go on and love will be forbidden , of course not sex since children are needed for the war to go on : so let 's procreate more and more little soldiers . But love is just an extra-terrestrial concept . Dr Jacques COULARDEAU , University Paris Dauphine & University Paris 1 Pantheon Sorbonne
For anyone who has only seen Disney Productions beautifully animated version of 'Beauty & The Beast ' , or even Jean Cocteau 's surreal fairy tale vision will be quite taken aback by this 1975 French ( but with a director from Poland ) version . The plot concerns a French family of fading aristocracy that is marrying into a well to do English family . The major catch is that the bridegroom is carrying an ancient curse on the family . The film also includes many flashback sequences ( potentially ) explaining this family curse . From the opening credits , to the very end , it 's a nearly non stop erotic fun house ride , with some VERY explicit & graphic sexual content ( hence the film 's X rating in the U.S. in it 's initial run , which is now unrated ) . The film 's somewhat contemptuous sentiment at the ruling class will probably remind one of Bunuel 's flights into similar territory . If you have a taste for the truly bizarre , and are not offended by `` taboo '' material , then this film may just scratch that itch for you .
I saw this movie with my family and it was great ! This film is more than just a documentary ( that offers not more than cold facts ) with long mono/-duologue 's and lots of charts ... The complete `` power '' of this movie comes from the impressive pictures being filmed under water , in the air or the Arctic.With watching this movie you can learn more about our planet than with just reading a book , it shows that WE are embedded in the circular flow of life . This movie is not only for `` environmental fanatics '' although people that want to look a good movie with a message should watch it . This movie taught me that we are not only living on the earth ... we live with and through the earth and all plants and animals grow and die with us .
Any story comprises a premise , characters and conflict . Characters plotting their own play promises triumph , and a militant character readily lends oneself to this . Ardh Satya 's premise is summarized by the poem of the same name scripted by Dilip Chitre . The line goes - `` ek palde mein napunsaktha , doosre palde mein paurush , aur teek tarazu ke kaante par , ardh satya ? '' . A rough translation - `` The delicate balance of right & wrong ( commonly seen on the busts of blind justice in the courts ) has powerlessness on one plate and prowess on another . Is the needle on the center a half-truth ? `` The poem is recited midway in the film by Smita Patil to Om Puri at a resturant . It makes a deep impact on the protagonist & lays the foundation for much of the later events that follow . At the end of the film , Om Puri ends up in exactly the same situation described so aptly in the poem . The film tries mighty hard to do a one-up on the poem . However , Chitre 's words are too powerful , and at best , the film matches up to the poem in every aspect .
This film and it 's sequel Barry Mckenzie holds his own , are the two greatest comedies to ever be produced . A great story a young Aussie bloke travels to england to claim his inheritance and meets up with his mates , who are just as loveable and innocent as he is . It 's chock a block full of great , sayings , where else could you find someone who needs a drink so bad that he 's as dry as a dead dingoes donger ? great characters , top acting , and it 's got great sheilas and more Fosters consumption then any other three films put together . Top notch . And some of the funniest songs you 'll ever hear , and it 's full of great celebrities . Definitely my two favourite films of all time , I watch them at least once a fortnight .
One thing i can say about this movie is well long , VERY LONG ! I actually recently purchased this movie a couple of months ago seeing that there was a new version coming out . I was happy to find that it was made in 1978 because The 70 's ( even though i never lived in them ) is actually one of my favourite decades , especially for the music ! when i watched this movie the story was actually very good at the start but then after about 50 mins it started to get very boring and repetitive . i will admitt the animation did impress me ! it was nothing i had ever seen before and was well pretty cool to see . but the movie honestly could of been a bit better , it could of had alot more talking and story to it than just 15 to 20 minute scenes that just had wierd fighting . then for the last 5 or 10 minutes the movie picked up and got good again but ended unexpectedly . in my opinion i thought it was EXTREMELY long . i know its 13 minutes over 2 hours and that is still long for a cartoon but since it was boring for most of the movie , it made it seem like it was 4 hours long ! ! ! ! but overall it is an okay film i guess and i will watch it again on one of those `` nothing to do days '' . i will see the new one and i hope it is better !
What can you say about the film White Fire . Amazing ? Fantastic ? Disturbing ? Hilarious ? These words are not big enough to describe the event which is White Fire . From wobbly , garbled beginning to profound end , this movie will entertain throughout . Our movie begins in the woods of a country somewhere in the world . A family is hiding from unmarked soldiers in costume shop uniforms . When the father separates from the mother and their childen , you get a real sense of what kind of movie you 're about to watch . Father makes sure to roll down hills in his all white outfit , and is polite as he gets people 's attention before he shoots them , but alas , dad is burned alive in what looks like a very unsupervised , unsafe stunt . Meanwhile , mom and the kids are running down a beach with an armed soldier trailing about 5 feet behind them . He too gives a stern warning before action in the form of a bizarre `` HALT ! `` , and then promptly wastes the mother . This action sequence sets up the happy childhood of our heroes Bo and Ingred . So now we fast forward about 20 years ( 30 if you 're honest about the hero 's age ) to beautiful Turkey , where Bo and Ingred have settled as professional thieves , or diamond prospectors , or something . Ingred works at a diamond mine where she helps herself to the goods , while Bo ( masterfully played by the dynamic Robert Ginty ) drives around the desert in his denim outfits . Bo and Ingrid have an interesting relationship . They do n't seem to have any friends other than each other , and they spend all of their time together . That coupled with the fact that Bo has expressed his desire to sleep with his sister as evidenced in lines such as `` you know its a shame you 're my sister '' he says to her while she 's stark naked , make for a very dynamic duo . Bo is then crushed when Ingrid is killed , as he wanders the beaches of Turkey with his ceremonial pink grief scarf . A renewal of hope occurs when Bo finds a girl who looks like Ingrid , and gives her plastic surgery to make her look exactly like Ingrid . This opens the door for Bo to have sex with his sister without it being technically wrong . Bo is a real fan of ethical grey areas , and he is overjoyed with his new love . So anyway , there 's a lot of fun action scenes , ridiculous violence , great acting , impossible to follow plot-lines , Fred `` the hammer '' Williamson ( for some reason ) , and a big chunk of dirty ice which is supposed to be a giant diamond ( which later explodes ) . All of these things are great , but the Bo and Ingrid relationship is what makes this movie special ... .really special . So I heartily encourage everyone to behold the majesty that is White Fire . You may be glad you did..or not .
A winters day , 28th December 1986 , two bored 14 year olds hire a movie . `` Hmmmm , Police Story , looks interesting '' , `` who is this Jackie Chan ? `` , `` never heard of him '' . Two hours later after watching the film , in a daze , we wanted to know more . 16 years later ( and severely out of pocket from collecting JC movies ! ) the film still grabs me like no other . Ok , maybe I have a soft spot for it as it was my `` first '' ( Cannonball Run does n't count ! ! ) JC movie , but it is an excellent movie . It has all the classic JC elements , Action , Humour , Action , Heart and ACTION ! Some comments say it 's dated , it was made in 1985 , of course it 's dated ! But then so must Jaws , Casablanca , Singin ' in the Rain and The Godfather ! ! ! ! ! ! Without movies like Police Story where would Hollywood action be today ? PS set standards , many a scene has been stolen for use in other movies . To really fully appreciate it you must see it in widescreen , you miss so much of the movie otherwise ( yes , he really does fall off the bus going round the corner ! ) . If you have n't already , SEE THIS MOVIE NOW ! ! ! !
Mystery Men is one of those movies that gets funnier over time . There is a naive innocence and `` niceness '' to the characters . It has become part of our family `` culture , '' and we quote the characters often . It is my favorite film of the last two years . My kids are 13 and 11 and we all three love this film . Great acting and comedy . We love Galaxy Quest and Monty Python flicks too . Okay , we 're not talking intellectual here , just Family bonding !
In the tradition of G-Men , The House On 92nd Street , The Street With No Name , now comes The FBI Story one of those carefully supervised films that showed the Federal Bureau of Investigation in the best possible light . While it 's 48 year director J. Edgar Hoover was alive , it would be showed in no other kind of light . The book by Don Whitehead that this film is based on is a straight forward history of the bureau from it 's founding in 1907 until roughly the time the film The FBI Story came out . It 's important sometimes to remember there WAS an FBI before J. Edgar Hoover headed it . Some of that time is covered in the film as well . But Warner Brothers was not making a documentary so to give the FBI flesh and blood the fictional character of John 'Chip ' Hardesty was created . Hardesty as played by James Stewart is a career FBI man who graduated law school and rather than go in practice took a job with the bureau in the early twenties . In real life the Bureau was headed by William J. Burns of the Burns Private Detective Agency . It was in fact a grossly political operation then as is showed in the film . Burns was on the periphery of the scandals of the Harding administration . When Hoover was appointed in 1924 to bring professional law enforcement techniques and rigorous standards of competence in , he did just that . Through the Hardesty family which is Stewart and wife Vera Miles we see the history of the FBI unfold . In addition we see a lot of their personal family history which is completely integrated into the FBI 's story itself . Stewart and Miles are most assuredly an all American couple . We follow the FBI through some of the cases Stewart is involved with , arresting Ku Klux Klan members , a plot to murder oil rich Indians , bringing down the notorious criminals of the thirties , their involvement with apprehending Nazi sympathizers in World War II and against Communist espionage in the Cold War . There is a kind of prologue portion where Stewart tells a class at the FBI Academy before going into the history of the bureau as it intertwines with his own . That involves a bomb placed on an airline by a son who purchased a lot of life insurance on his mother before the flight . Nick Adams will give you the creeps as the perpetrator and the story is sadly relevant today . Of course if The FBI Story were written and produced today it would reflect something different and not so all American . Still the FBI does have a story to tell and it is by no means a negative one . The FBI Story is not one of Jimmy Stewart 's best films , but it 's the first one I ever saw with my favorite actor in it so it has a special fondness for me . If the whole FBI were made up Jimmy Stewarts , I 'd feel a lot better about it . There 's also a good performance by Murray Hamilton as his friend and fellow agent who is killed in a shootout with Baby Face Nelson . Vera Miles did n't just marry Stewart , she in fact married the FBI as the film demonstrates . It 's dated mostly , but still has a good and interesting story to tell .
A charming little film set in the UK about the reunion of a WWII all girl ( almost ) swing band . A fine cast of oldsters bring lighthearted perspectives on life to this fun tale with an award winning performance by Dench and Laine 's always great `` pipes '' . Time well spent and a fun watch for all .
What a delightful movie . The characters were not only lively but alive , mirroring real every day life and strife within a family . Each character brought a unique personality to the story that the audience could easily associate with someone they know within their own family or circle of close friends . The story has a true-to-life flow that the viewer can assimilate into and be part of the drama , the laughter and tears as the plot of the movie develops . The script does a good job of capturing the common emotions , actions and reactions of the characters to conflict , opinion , and resolve . Not an epic , but it is a very nice movie to watch with loved ones . Plenty of knowing head nods and 'ahhh ' moments to share and enjoy .
I have seen a lot of PPV 's in the past but this is the most entertaining , intense PPV and the most complete DVD i have ever seen . The DVD extras are worth it because they it gives a different view of how the wrestlers act after the show ( such as the chris benoit interview/edge interview ) , some glimpse into the Monday Night Wars era , the first match of Hogan winning tag title gold and some promotional talk . Additionally there is a good music video . 1 . Tag Team Table match : Bubby Ray and Spike Dudley vs. Eddie Guerro and Chris benoit 7/10 This was a pretty good intense match to start off the show . Not too many holds and just pure raw physicallity . Spike can hold his own in tables matches and Guerro and Benoit gave good pure wrestling skills on the mat . 2 . WWE Crusierweight championship : Jamie Noble w/ Nidia v. Billy Kidman 3/10 The crowd really did n't care about either wrestler and did n't get interested until Kidman did a shooting star press . Usually people expect a lot of high flying in a cruiser weight championship , but this had very little . In fact it was so bad that when Noble hit his finisher , no one even cared or knew ( you can tell by the lack of camera 's flashing ) . The ending was quick though . 3 . WWE European Championship : Jeff hardy v. William Regal 5/10 I 've never really liked regal as a wrestler , he lacks intensity and style . Hardy was impressive but really did n't get a chance to show off his high flying act , although he still performed some good counters and added that needed fast pace to the match . It ended off quickly which was perfect for this match . 4 . John Cena v. Chris Jericho 6/10 It 's funny looking back at Cena 's very first PPV , how he used to act , how he used to dress , and how he used to look ( watch his interview , it 's pretty funny ) . This was a good intense match with Cena showing a nice variety of holds , suplexes , counters and some aerial . Jericho was sub-par but definitely helped Cena launch his career . Cena Wins . 5 . WWE Intercontenital championship : RVD v. Brock Lesnar 8/10 This was a very intense and good match . Both wrestlers styles really matched up well on the screen , with Brocks pure power and raw energy vs. RVDs skill full moves and quickness . RVD looked great in this match ( better than his later matches with edge and cena ) and the entire match was fast pace . The ending worked perfectly because it still preserved Brock 's undefeated streak while giving RVD his just desserts in his home state . 6 . No disqualification match : Booker T v. Big Show 7/10 Another solid match that lacked a certain intensity as the RVD match but still a good follow up . Although it started off kinda slow ( which it always is with big show ) Booker T was impressive and did a sick move on the announcers table . The finisher was awesome , the ending was a great upset and big move up for Booker T. 7 . WWE Tag Team Championship : Hogan and Edge v. Christian and Lance storm 5/10 This was a mediocre match . Hogan comes out like usual to a huge pop but his variety of moves lacks that intensity and energy . Then again Christian does n't exactly have the greatest athletic abilities himself . This ended up being a mediocre match at best but was still OK for PPV . 8 . Triple Threat Match for the Undisputed Championship : 10/10 . Rock v. Undertaker v. Kurt Angle . Easily the match of the year . This is by far the best triple threat match i have ever seen . It had close falls , plenty of finishers , stolen finishers , raw energy , intensity and fast pace . No one could predict who would come out of this one . If your going to buy this DVD i would buy it strictly for this match . ( ending ? watch for yourself ! ) Overall this was a solid PPV with plenty of extra goodies to keep you watching again and again . Although this is hard to find ( i had to pay a little more than usual for this DVD ) it is definitely worth your money .
I 'm intrigued by the strong sense of favour towards ( or sympathy for ! ) Sinatra in the other reviews here . I 've read elsewhere that Sinatra never seems to have forgiven anyone for *not* being cast as Sky Masterson . OK , so who would n't want to be cast as Sky Masterson ?  it 's a great part : the charismatic successful gambler who makes a grave mistake when he allows himself to be suckered into a bet , in which he must take Salvation Army Sargeant Sarah Brown on a date to Cuba , or lose . It 's not the money  it 's the pride , but he and she meet their match . Meanwhile Nathan Detroit must juggle his long-suffering fiancée Adelaide with trying to find a spot for a craps game which will make him rich if it does n't alienate his fiancée forever first . The film started life as a series of short stories by Damon Runyon : that 's his unique dialogue you hear , and those are his great character names , and that 's his horse-racing/nightclub/late night gambling world . Then it became a musical , and you ca n't help but feel that in film form it never really left the stage . The camera is unusually static and the sets remarkably  and not pleasingly  flat and childlike . Fortunately the music is so great , I do n't care that much . My absolute favourite thing about this film , though , is the singing and acting of the two non-singers , Brando ( as Sky ) and Jean Simmons ( as Sargeant Sarah Brown ) . Of course , putting pro singers into these roles would have produced better music ; but what surely gets forgotten is that two such excellent actors brought something else to the party instead : what they lacked in vocal talent they more than made up for in gusto , acting ability , and pathos , pathos , pathos . You 're with Sky as he argues with Sarah against reason , steadiness , pipes and safety . You enjoy Sarah 's loosening up under the influence of Cuban `` milk '' . You feel completely the suddenness and passion of their scene in the courtyard with bells ringing and an hour to go before the plane takes them home . As Sky rightly says , it 's `` chemistry '' . Pro singers  be they Broadway belters or smooth crooners  ca n't necessarily be relied on to make this happen . ( And they certainly did n't . ) I read somewhere that Brando criticised Sinatra for not putting all of himself into his role of Nathan Detroit . Sinatra in turn was infuriated by Brando 's four-take acting method . As a Brando fan ( does it show ? ! ) I 'm bound to take the other side , but I ca n't imagine that this film would have been the much-adored classic it is today if Brando and Simmons had n't been in it with their wonderful chemistry ; Brando 's unpredictability ; Simmons ' face , all pink cheeks and brown hair , drunk and ashamed in a Cuban bar . Beautiful . I 'll always want a copy of this film lying around in case I need to feel good again . You 'll forgive me if give some of the Nathan ( sleep ) talking parts the 100 % brush-off though , wo n't you ? You wo n't ? Oh , be quiet and have some more of Mindy 's cheesecake !
It 's very hard to say just what was going on with `` The Lady from Shanghai '' and what the film could have been without studio interference . Orson Welles ' prime interest in film at this point was to raise money for his theater ; indeed , funding his own projects is what drove him to seek out acting jobs . He made `` Lady from Shanghai '' for his soon to be ex-wife , Rita Hayworth . Harry Cohn was fearful for Rita 's image and held back the release of this movie for one year . The plot concerns an Irish sailor , Michael O'Hara , who falls in love with Else ( Hayworth , stunning with short blond hair ) . Her husband is a well known criminal attorney Arthur Bannister ( Everett Sloane ) who is as crippled on the inside as he is out . He hires O'Hara to work on his yacht , and there O'Hara is drawn deeper and deeper into a web of murder and deceit . `` The Lady from Shanghai '' moves at a snail 's pace , though I agree with one of the posters that films today are criticized for taking time to build a plot . Still , this movie drags . The scene in the fun house is fantastic - Welles wanted it without music , though , and I believe the studio cut it down . It 's a shame . The photography throughout is stunning , atmospheric , bold , and very stylish . Welles was an excellent actor , handsome in his youth , charismatic and possessing a magnificent voice and technique , but in many films , it 's almost as if he does n't trust himself or does n't take the time to develop a character . Instead he relies on externals such as accents and fake noses . One of the only times he did n't do this was `` Tomorrow is Forever , '' where the director gets an excellent , deeply felt performance out of him . Contrast that with `` Compulsion '' where he shows he is a master of pure technical acting as he phones in his performance . Here Welles is doing quadruple duty - as director , star , co-writer and narrator . Sporting a completely unnecessary accent and looking intense was a fast way to a characterization . Nevertheless , he is always compelling . The supporting players are excellent , including Sloan and Glenn Anders . Hayworth , gorgeous and soft-voiced ( her singing was again dubbed by Anita Ellis ) is as usual a complete goddess and one of the great screen presences . What a sad life for such a vibrant beauty . Any film that Orson Welles directed is worth seeing , and `` The Lady from Shanghai '' is no exception . But this one leaves the viewer frustrated , as does `` The Magnificent Ambersons '' - as does any work that Welles did within the studio system . He was a great artist who should have been given a freer reign ; he was n't . He was a strange dichotomy - he needed more freedom , but as is evidenced by some of his later work , he needed the structure of the studio . Alas , he could n't have both .
I LOVE the Doodlebops . My son has been watching them for over a year . We went to the Doodlebops concert last year as well as one concert yesterday ( connecticut ) . He LOVES them . The doodlebops do not teach the alphabet or numbers but who cares ? are you being serious ? the TV is n't suppose to teach your children about numbers or the alphabet . the parents should . Get over it . The Doodlebops actually CAN sing . Deedee has a beautiful voice and in concert you can tell all 3 of them have nice singing voices and do NOT lip sing . Imagine , they dance , jump around and STILL sing . they have talent , the kids love them i even enjoy watching the show . This show is by far the best show on TV for kids . AND a rock band for children . How amazing is that ? Why are people saying Chad ( rooney ) is gay ? where did you hear that from ? Whether he is or not , He is awesome ! Leave him alone . Its not like he or anyone else is promoting homosexuality to our children !
Victor Nunez imbues this unsentimental tale of a young woman 's emotional journey with a sense of poetry seldom seen in cinema . By poetry I mean the sense in which the literary and the cinematic come into play . There is something very literary about the film , almost as if a novel has been adapted page by page to screen . In this sense , the film achieves depths many can not ; but it is also rather slow at other times , undercutting the depths it once achieved in favor of ennui . The film 's star Ashley Judd has not yet made a better film than her debut here . She fits the role of lead Ruby like a glove , almost as if she did n't have to act . She has true movie star presence in the film , and has n't really managed to convey the same allure in her later films , although she was impressive in Normal Life .
So , what 's the reason ? Is there some sort of vendetta against this AWESOME show or somebody involved therein ? Why would the best show I 've seen in years be canceled ? I 'm addicted . I saw this show on randomly last fall , and immediately loved it , and watched it every week . Then it went away , and I tried to Tivo it , but it was n't being aired . So I forgot about it for awhile , until I found the episodes on ABC 's website . Now I want MORE . I agree with everybody else - with the rest of the junk on TV today , it was refreshing to see something as well-rounded and developed as this . I watch Boston Legal for my eccentric-comedic fix , and House for my intellectual-mystery-jackass fix . My wife loves Grey 's Anatomy for its `` realism '' , and I do love/hate the show , but it could not be farther from real for me . WAY too much drama . Everything that can go wrong , does . But for once , there 's a drama that 's REALLY real . Real people , real problems . Sure , there are some extremes like a former gangster turned good , girl running from the mob , etc. , but these people ( especially in NYC ) are really out there , and I relate to each and every one of them . I ca n't seem to get enough . I just hope that ABC will get their heads out of their bean-counting butts and continue this show . Get some respect for having a QUALITY drama out there . This could be one of the best shows of all time . If somebody will just let it .
I 'm one of those people who usually watch programs and keep my feelings about a show private . However , Pushing Daisies is my exception . I became curious about the program from the commercials that aired which gave glimpses of the premise of the show . I was skeptical about it at first , especially after the finale of Six Feet Under was still in my head . Here we go again , I thought . I watched the first , second , third and all the other episodes . Wow ! First of all , I thought it took the subject of death and presented in a way that was palatable without being morbid . The characters were engaging and I like the thought of Ned the main character not being able to literally touch the love of his life , Chuck without the consequences of her dying . Most of the characters have a longing for things they ca n't have . Besides Ned and Chuck , Olive longs for Ned . Lily and Vivian longs for their niece Chuck and Emerson is always longing for the monetary rewards from the mysterious deaths they solve . I think the characters are picture perfect and believable . I like how Emerson who is black plays off of the rest of the characters since as an African American ; I like the subtle cultural humor that sometimes comes from him . All in all , this visual fairytale is one of the most valuable pieces of entertainment that I 've seen out of the 2007 season . I think the show has enough romance for the romantics and enough who-done-it for the mystery buffs . I just wish the writers would get back to work , so that the show can continue to evolve .
No awards show can please all the people . Clearly if your favorite movies did n't win , you will say the show was n't very good . That 's understandable . However , the 74th Annual Academy Awards will be remembered for one magical moment of Hollywood history : Woody Allen 's first appearance ever at the Academy Awards . Allen has often shunned the awards as being self-aggrandizing and pointless , and has never attended -- even though he has won several of the coveted awards . When the 74th Academy Awards were held , the nation was still mourning the loss of life in the collapse of the World Trade Centers in New York . When it came time to pay tribute to the city of New York , they decided to show a video of the great movie moments form the city of cities . Then the announcer simply said : `` Ladies and gentleman , Oscar Award winning Director Woody Allen . '' The place erupted in an extremely long standing ovation . The entertainment industry finally got to give their applause to the Man from New York who usually avoids the Hollywood scene . As the applause died down , Woody applied some of his legendary wit to the situation . SOME HIGHLIGHTS : `` Thank you very much - that makes up for the strip search . '' `` I thought they wanted their Oscars back , '' he joked . `` I panicked because the pawn shop has been out of business for ages and I had no way of retrieving anything. `` `` But that was n't it . I could n't work it out because my movie was n't nominated for anything this year . Then it hit me - maybe they were calling to apologise . '' Allen also disclosed why he had overlooked his lifelong Oscar-aversion for this one special night . `` For New York City , I 'd do anything . So I got my tux on and came down here , '' said Allen . `` It 's a great , great movie town . It 's been a great , moving and exciting backdrop for movies and it remains a great , great city . ''
The Sarah Silverman program is very similar to Sarah 's own stand up ; It 's so over the top with prejudice that you ca n't possibly take it to heart . The fact is , though , that while most all people will `` get it , '' it does n't mean they will all appreciate it . It 's a very polarizing and one dimensional show , so if you do n't like it after 10 minutes , you may as well give up there . If you do like it after 10 minutes , stay tuned , because every episode thus far has been as good as the last . Like all shows , though , it is not perfect . Personally I love the program , but there are some huge faults with it . Racist songs are funny , but get older a lot faster than Silverman seems to realize -- a problem that I had with `` Jesus is Magic '' as well . It seems as if Silverman gave herself a quota for songs per episode that does n't need to exist . Not to mention that while the lyrics to the songs she writes are good , the music , well , is n't . Another thing to keep in mind is that while this show will for some reason appeal to fans of Monty Python , Upright Citizens Brigade , etc. , it is nothing like those shows . I can watch Monty Python all day , but , as much as I like this show , I ca n't watch more than the half hour limit at a time . It gets flat very fast . The repeat value for this show is low too -- the second time around an episode is fairly funny , and by the third time , in my opinion , it 's boring . Still , that first time around is very , very funny . Give it a shot .
It is a superb Swedish film .. it was the first Swedish film I 've seen .. it is simple & deep .. what a great combination ! . Michael Nyqvist did a great performance as a famous conductor who seeks peace in his hometown . Frida Hallgren was great as his inspirational girlfriend to help him to carry on & never give up . The fight between the conductor and the hypocrite priest who loses his battle with Michael when his wife confronts him And defends Michael 's noble cause to help his hometown people finding their own peace in music . The only thing that I did n't like was the ending .. it was n't that good but it has some deep meaning .
Kurt Russell is at his best as the man who lives off his past glories , Reno Hightower . Robin Williams is his polar opposite in a rare low key performance as Jack Dundee . He dropped the Big Pass in more ways than one . You 'll see some of the most quotable scenes ever put into one film , as Jack hisses at a rat , Reno poses , and the call of the caribou goes out . Do n't miss this classic that is n't scared to show football in the mud the way it should be played ( note to the NFL ) .
I 'd never heard of this movie , but boy was I surprised when I caught it on TV . Great cast , great acting . Excellent movie ! How can a movie with William H Macy , Neve Campbell and Donald Sutherland go wrong ? I wonder why I never heard of it before .
One of those beautifully intense movies that draws us so intimately far in , it ends much to soon ! Than were left looking at the screen like , `` No they did n't ! `` , lol . Good performances all around ! The acting is marvelous with Emily Blunt simply outstanding ! I knew she would give a solid , convincing performance catching young Victoria 's regality , temper , and vulnerability through out the entire movie . Also , the production is outstanding in every way : style , substance and sensitivity . A remarkable glimpse at a remarkable time in Britian 's history told via a very personal and touching biography of the school age princess until her reign as Queen , later marrying Prince Albert , than ending with the birth of their first of nine children . It had a well written screenplay and flawless editing . Rupert Friend as the ever so patient and compassionate young Prince Albert vying to win the young Queen 's attention , than securing her love , before Lord Melbourne ( Paul Bettany ) , was engrossing to watch . Just as engrossing was the relationship between the teenage Victoria and her mother , which was fury at times , as with her mother and King William ( whom also disliked her mother ) . The acting and scenes were captivating , highly emotional . I would recommend this to anyone interested in the historical and political situation existing in that era , and indeed , anyone who loves a compelling true romance story
I gather from reading the previous comments that this film went straight to cable . Well , I paid to see it in a theatre , and I 'm glad I did because visually it was a striking film . Most of the settings seem like they were made in the early 60s ( except for the shrink 's office , which was dated in a different way ) , and if you leave the Neve Campbell sequences out , the whole film has a washed- out early 60s ambience . And the use of restaurants in the film was fascinating . For a first-time director whose background , I believe , is in writing , he has a great eye . Within the first ten minutes I felt the plot lacked plausibility , so I just willingly suspended my disbelief and went along for the ride . In terms of acting and the depiction of father-son , mother-son , husband-wife , parent-child relationships , the film was spot-on . William H. Macy , a pleasure to watch , seems to be filling the void left by the late Tony Perkins , if this and Magnolia are any indication . Tracey Ullman as the neglected wife was quite moving , to me . It was a three-dimensional depiction of a character too often viewed by society as two-dimensional . Of course , Donald Sutherland can add this to his collection of unforgettable portrayals . The depiction of the parents ( Bain/Sutherland ) reminded me , in an indirect way , of Vincent Gallo 's BUFFALO '66 , although toned-down quite a bit ! I would definitely pay money to see a second film from this director . He has the self-discipline of a 50s b-crimefilm director ( something P.T.Anderson will never have ! ) , yet he has a visual style and a way with actors that commands attention .
I would like to know why John Amos left the show , and how did he die off the show again ? I could n't relate to everything , but sometimes they hit home with the problems they were facing . By the way , did they ever make it out of the ghetto ? I think the episode with the black Jesus was my favorite . We got to see them experience a few good times . something they did n't have very often . I wish they would bring the show back . During the daytime so people can actually stay up to watch . I do n't think a movie or a new show would work . Especially without the original cast . They are really what made Good Times GoodTimes . These are my questions and comments . Thank You ! !
Wow , I ca n't believe I waited so long to see this film . I just never got around to watching it . The plot has nothing that interests me . I know nothing about soccer ( football . ) I am one of those American fools that has no clue . I had never even seen David Beckham before this film . I chose to ignore the buzz surrounding this film at the time it was released in America . Enough about me . Truth be told , it was a mistake to ignore this little piece of movie-making heaven . What a fun film . It 's full of color and exuberance . I had a goofy grin on my face through the whole movie . Parminder Nagra is so sweet and lovable , you ca n't help but root for her . No wonder why the American television show E.R . has snatched her up . I have a new appreciation for Indian culture . Those people know how to have a good time . The wedding scenes are dazzlingly beautiful . The only problem I had was deciphering some of the British slang and dialogue through the accents . I turned on the English subtitles to make sure I did n't miss anything . ( This is not a criticism of the film ! ) I 'm sure audiences worldwide have trouble understanding the constantly changing slang in American films as well . This is a perfect date film . It has a great sports plot like Rocky , and a strong sense of feminism that is empowering for women . I watched it with my wife , and sixteen year old niece , and we all loved it . I highly recommend it .
I did n't feel that this film was quite as clever as it seemed to think it was but enjoyed it nevertheless . It is original , although reminded me a little of two other French films , Vidocq and City of Lost Children , mostly for the colouring but also for the edgy quality of the close ups of the characters . Set in a prison cell but do not let this put you off , this film seemingly goes further than many a multi locationed blockbuster . Always interesting , with the perennial 'Black Arts ' well to the fore and very good characterisation making some only too believable ! Scary with some gore this is well worth a viewing .
Okay , let 's face it . this is a god-awful movie . The plot ( such as it is ) is horrible , the acting worse . But the movie was made for one reason and one reason only , like all of those awful Mario Lanza movies ... just to hear the voice of the star , in this case Pavarotti in his prime . Okay , so maybe the Lanza movies were also an excuse for him to hit on women , but this movie is about hearing Luciano . That alone is worth watching the movie . A big opera star stuck on himself faces his fears , finds humility and love along the way , and belts out a lot of hit numbers , too . I must admit I 'm prejudiced on a number of levels . I 'm Italian . I 'm a big Pavarotti fan ( is there anything about Pavarotti that is n't big , including his fan base ? ) . And when I first saw this movie I was going out on my own , seeing the height and depth of Life 's possibilities and in love for the first time . So as awful as this movie is , the beautiful voice and memories are enough to make me breathe deep of life and love again . Yes , it 's corny and awful . But the voice is immortal and timeless , and the voice is what it 's all about . So I give this movie a high rating in hopes that someone who has never heard Pavarotti before will listen and watch and enjoy a new level of music and love , especially since he is now gone . Like Italian food that you 've never tried before , try it ! You may be pleasantly surprised , as a Luciano lover or prospective Pavarotti peep .
A fantastic Arabian adventure . A former king , Ahmad , and his best friend , the thief Abu ( played by Sabu of Black Narcissus ) search for Ahmad 's love interest , who has been stolen by the new king , Jaffar ( Conrad Veidt ) . There 's hardly a down moment here . It 's always inventing new adventures for the heroes . Personally , I found Ahmad and his princess a little boring ( there 's no need to ask why John Justin , who plays Ahmad , is listed fourth in the credits ) . Conrad Veidt , always a fun actor , makes a great villain , and Sabu is a lot of fun as the prince of thieves , who at one point finds a genie in a bottle . I also really loved Miles Malleson as the Sultan of Basra , the father of the princess . He collects amazing toys from around the world . Jaffar bribes him for his daughter 's hand with a mechanical flying horse . This probably would count as one of the great children 's films of all time , but the special effects are horribly dated nowadays . Kids will certainly deride the superimposed images when Abu and the genie are on screen together . And the scene with the giant spider looks especially awful . Although most of the younger generation probably thinks that King Kong looks bad at this point in time , Willis O'Brien 's stop-motion animation is a thousand times better than a puppet on a string that does n't even look remotely like a spider . 8/10 .
I have always had the philosophy that every single human being has different tastes , i found this movie to be awesome and i think every college student out there might agree with me . Notwithstanding this is not a `` movie with a plot '' , its about real guys and some of the `` problems '' that they face . I found the movie hilarious ( especially the parts that they played the practical jokes on each other ) . Simply put , if you are in the same `` wave-length '' as these people , you will find this movie amazing . I do n't think that this is going win any Golden Globes or Oscars , or that the people in this movie will become future Hollywood stars , but its a kind of `` cult-classic '' among young people who could relate to their experience . For me the guy that stands out the most is Hans : the Scandinavian guy , who , according to him `` isnt a looker '' , but gets all ( or some ) of the chicks . The `` little-people '' also play a big part in the movie , especially when they are drunk . If i keep going , i might provide a spoiler and i do n't want to do that , just go and get the movie and you will not regret . I give it a 8/10
Let 's cut a long story short . I loved every minute of it . A lavish fantasy in true Arabian-Nights style . There 's an evil magician , a pretty princess , a djinn and everybody lives happily ever after . Modern Hollywoond sure does have one or two things to learn from this classic . Only quibble : the special effects are pretty dated ( loved Sabu with the djinn 's foot , though ! )
If I did n't know any better , it almost seems like it was staged , but it was n't . It was set up perfectly , and how they got all of that footage is amazing ! The unfortunate events of September 11 , 2001 are put together well in this documentary and the classic footage that they got made this an unfortunate classic . Just the history in the footage alone should make it a MUST see for any american or person touched by the tragedy of September 11 .
For those of you who think anime is just about giant reptiles raping schoolgirls , think again . There is a totally different side to the Japanese animation . Yakitate ! Japan is one of those shows . It is a sweet-natured tale of a young boy with the gift to make delicious bread . His universe is all about creating a Japanese bread that can match with the famous European breads . The show is as wacky as they come and I 'm sure that non-Japanese viewers will miss a lot of the jokes . But it is still very nice to watch because of the complete innocent vibe of the show . In the world of Yakitate ! it is not uncommon for people to look like they 've just had an orgasm after eating bread . The bread is hallucinating and can give the consumer a wide array of super powers , from time-traveling to swimming like a fish . That weird aspect makes it into one of the least predictable and funny shows I 've watched in a while .
The first film ever made . Workers streaming from a factory , some cycling , most walking , moving right or left . Along with Melies , the Lumieres are both the starting point and the point of departure for cinema - with Melies begins narrative fiction , cinema , fantasy , artifice , spectacle ; with the Lumieres pure , unadorned , observation . The truth . There are many intellectuals who regret the ossification of cinema from the latter into the tired formulae of the former . But consider this short again . There is nothing 'objective ' about it . The film is full of action - a static , inhuman scene burst into life , activity , and the quiet harmony of the frame is ruptured , decentred from the back to right or left ( but never , of course , the front , where the camera is ) . And yet the camera stands stock still , contains the energy , the possible subversion , subordinates it to its will . The cinematograph may be a revolutionary invention , but it will be used for conservative purposes - to map out the world , edit it , restrict it , limit it . worse is the historical reality of the film . These factory workers are Lumiere employees . The bosses are spying on their workers , the unseen eye regarding his faceless minions . The film therefore describes two types of imprisonment . Behind the gates , the workers are confined in their workplace . The opening of the gate seems to be an image of freedom , escape , but they face another wall , the fourth wall , further confining them . The first film is also the first example of CCTV surveillance , an image of unseen , all-seeing authority entrapping its servants . A frightening , all too prophetic movie .
Though Cher and Cage are the focal points of this story , Gardenia and Dukakis are good counterparts for them- this is where Loretta and Ronny will be in 50 years- still in love . The whole cast does a nice job from Aiello to John Mahoney- it shows a real slice of life . Though I saw this long ago- I am glad it finally catapulted Cage to the place where he was recognized in Hollywood for his talent . From the music to the scenes at the opera to the kitchen table arguments- this is a very entertaining movie .
What a great Barbara Stanwyck film that I happened to see the other night . `` Jeopardy '' was fantastic . It was made in 1953 and probably for double bills but it kept me on the edge of my seat . Barbara Stanwyck plays Helen , who with husband Doug ( Barry Sullivan ) and son ( Lee Aaker ) drive to an isolated fishing spot in Mexico for a vacation . Husband has a fall from the jetty and the only way he is to be saved is if Barbara drives back to a garage for some rope . While there she runs into a psychotic killer ( Ralph Meeker - one of my favourites ) and what follows is a game of cat and mouse as Barbara tries everything in her power to get Meeker to come back with her to free her husband . The film was so suspenseful and such a surprise - I was not expecting such a great film . But I suppose I should have realized - is there anything Barbara Stanwyck does that is anything less than wonderful ?
***SPOILERS*** ***SPOILERS*** Well , seeing as I am a major H : LOTS fan , maybe I liked the movie more than normal people would . However , this movie is still excellent . It had tons of surprises , and it gave some more closure to the series . While I was sad that Bayliss turned into a murderer , the overall feeling I felt was satisfied .
I just saw this delightful Japanese feature film at the 5th Annual Roger Ebert Overlooked Film Festival in the historic Virginia Theatre in Champaign , Illinois . Although this film , subtitled in English , has ballroom dancing as its heart , the film actually shows the world outside of Japan how the rigid structures of family , employment ( salaryman ) , and recreation still exist in Modern day Japan . Writer/director Suo Masauki [ I follow Japanese custom of presenting the family name ( last name ) first and the given name ( last ) ] uses the not so very popular theme of ballroom dancing to show the societal structure of Japan . [ Also , I shall not use the movie character names when world readers may not be familiar with Japanese formal names which may confuse . I will refer to the actors by their professional acting name as listed in the Internet Data Movie Base . ] He enlists the aid of his real-life wife , professional ballet dancer Kusakari Tamiyo in her first and , so far , only motion picture . She is a dance teacher at her father 's dance studio . Yet , her real ambition is to compete once more in an International Dance Competition which she was disqualified from in the past . No , I wo n't say `` why . '' See the movie . Salaryman Yakusyo Koji is the main star of the film . A veteran of about 25 films since 1979 , he gives a sterling performance of a 40 's something companyman who has a lovely wife , teenage daughter , and just purchased the house of his longing . And , yet , something is missing from his own inner happiness . See this film to learn how he becomes `` involved '' with ballroom dancing and secretly goes to lessons . Most of the dancing characters are liberated from the traditional Japanese hierarchy of social structure . They are friendly and warm and inviting . Of course , this is in sharp contrast to how Japanese society is structured with it 's `` place for everyone and everyone in its place '' philosophy . The movie has so many funny moments . The almost 1,500 theater goers broke into spontaneous laughter during many of the comedic moments . This proves that comedy has no foreign language . Veteran actor Takenaka Naoto is funny and brilliant as well as Watanabe Eriko . They are two funny character actors . One could purchase and read a college text book regarding the structure of life in Japan , or , you could watch this fine film and begin to understand how the people of Japan grow up in a fairly rigid societal structure . Watching the movie `` Shall we Dansu ? '' is a quick immersion into further study and viewing other Japanese films . I recommend this film to all . It 's funny , it 's charming , it will make you cry a little , and it will warm your heart .
Fascinating movie , based on a true story , about an Australian woman , Lindy Chamberlain ( Meryl Streep ) accused of killing her baby daughter . She insists that a dingo took her baby , but the story is highly suspicious . The film is actually about the media circus that took place around the case , the way Australians interpreted what was presented in the media , and the lynch mob mentality that ultimately led to the woman 's conviction , based on barely any hard evidence . I love films that question the media , and also films that take a hard look on how people are railroaded by the justice system . I 've always thought that juries ought to be showed 12 Angry Men before they go through with their duties . It 's not , as has often been said , a liberal movie , but a clinical look at how we as human beings interpret events based so much on our prejudices and a desire for revenge . A Cry in the Dark is likewise clinical . Schepisi is careful not to make the film at all melodramatic . Some may find the film boring or dry , but I found it engaging .
I saw this at a screening last night too . I was totally blown away at how much better this movie was than what I expected . Not many movies can combine dark comedy and current event drama and not have it fall apart in the conclusion . I wo n't bother rehashing the plot too much because I think the less you know about this movie going into it makes it that much better . But I will say that Adam Sandler 's performance was really refreshing and real . He was funny , and much funnier than most of his most recent comedies . Don Cheadle was believable as always . This movie is n't funny like Borat or Billy Madison but it has a good pace about it . I 'd say 90 % of the audience laughed for most of the film . Midway through the movie slows down to address the drama end of things and does a really nice job of tying it all together . I also thought it was really cool how instead of playing up the whole black friend/white friend thing they chose to just ignore it and focus on the relationships themselves .
I had watched as much of the series as I could manage to watch on television , but unfortunately , started a job that got me working evenings . I managed to catch some recordings of it , at least ... and , of course , purchased the recently released DVD of the complete series . Watching the DVD , you can see that the animation was a bit more crude at first , but they ironed out a fair number of the flaws after the pilot was done . The voices are well suited to the characters , and the writing is excellent . It 's rather refreshing to see animation getting back to it 's roots by reintroducing adult themes . Thing is , with the way society has come in the last century , you need to be a bit more blatant about it by today 's standards in order to be recognised as an adult-oriented show . The characters have very realistic personalities and are placed in situations that parallel what we often face in real life . It 's your typical sitcom in that regard , but the humor is more like what you 'd expect from late night television like a talk show skit or Saturday Night Live ... back when SNL was actually funny . Good job , Dreamworks . Perhaps you need to work with one of the more liberal networks to keep this series going ... and also improve the marketing of merchandise for the series to help defray it 's high costs . It 's a challenge to do this for a cartoon of a mature nature though . Hmm ...
The young Dr. Fanshawe ( Mark Letheren ) , an avid archaeologist , is dispatched by his Museum boss to the large country home of Squire Richards ( Pip Torrens ) , where his task is to find provenance for and catalogue the collection of antiquities and curios belonging to the recently deceased father of the Squire . The Squire is surprised by the arrival Fanshawe , he had n't been expecting him for another week , but none the less welcomes him and gets his only servant , Patten ( David Burke..of Dr Watson fame ) , to show him to his room , as Fanshawe must stay over for some days in order to finish his rather large task . Patten it would seem is not the friendliest sort and seems to resent the extra work that Fanshawe 's visit will entail , the large empty house providing an endless amount of cooking , cleaning and maintenance for him . Fanshawe is a fussy sort , very neat and precise with everything having its place , whether they be his clothes or his books and papers and he is rather disgusted by the dirt in his room . Needless to say he is rather eager to begin his work , but unpacking he finds his binoculars have been damaged in transit , so he asks the Squire for a replacement pair , The Squire who is a modern thinking man but also it would seem rather uncultured with such matters , is also eager to get rid of the clutter around the house , so he obliges and walks Fanshawe to the top of the hill so that he can survey the estate and the surrounding villages , there the Squire directs him to points of interest , including Gallows Hill , where locals were hung for their crimes and misdemeanours , his interest is also taken by a local abbey which the Squire describes as a ruin , but Fanshawe can see through the binoculars that it clearly is n't , he investigates further and pays a visit to the site of the abbey and is shocked to find that there are but a few stone remnants ? Fanshawe does n't have too much time to think about this conundrum as he darkness falls he feels he is being watched , he feels a presence , he begins to see moving shadows in the woods , startled he runs home . Over dinner he imparts details of his harrowing day to the Squire , Patten overhears the story and suggests an explanation for it..The Binoculars ! they used to belong to a local man called Baxter , whom it would seem collected bones and skulls from Gallows Hill , boiling them up for some concoction or other , Baxter had disappeared mysteriously one night , the late Squire had acquired his belongings , including a mask made out of a skull and some old etchings of the area . These etchings fascinate Fanshawe as they portray the Abbey he seen through his binoculars , but he learns that the abbey had been destroyed during the reign of Henry VII and so it would be impossible for Baxter to have drawn the sketches , never the less they are signed and dated by Baxter to the recent past so he concludes that the binoculars have some special power . That night he has horrifically vivid dreams , when he wakes , he sets off with the binoculars to have a closer look at the abbey through them , what he finds surprises him but has he put himself in perilous danger by doing so ? Fanshawe finally becomes trapped in his dangerous obsession , as darkness falls the Squire and a search party go in search of the now missing archaeologist , they are alerted by dozens of loudly cawing crows circling above Gallows HIll , they quicken their speed , but will they be in time to help or save Fanshawe from his destiny ? The Ghost Story for Christmas series of films made by the BBC sadly ended its initial run of films in 1978 with The Ice House , they were for the most part based on the work of the great M.R . James . In 2005 and 2006 the series was revived briefly and thankfully A View from a Hill also marked a return to the work of James , whose ghostly writings have haunted many generations of readers . Director Luke Watson being new to the series might have worried fans of the older films , but he returns to the period setting abandoned by the later films which immediately sets the tone for a great Ghost story , his direction is assured as he stays true to the mood of the masters works and gradually builds up the fear factor to a terrifying climax , all the while keeping what the viewer sees to a minimum , thus upping the tension and mystery . The Autumn countryside provides oodles of atmosphere , the falling leaves and low lying sun providing an unsettling backdrop for the sinister events to come . The cast it must be said are all superb and are perfectly cast in their respective roles . The idea behind the binoculars is simple but very effective , the use of a man made object to see supernatural beings and events that the naked eye can not see , may even have influenced Álex de la Iglesia in his film La habitación del niño ( 2006 ) of the following year , with which it bears striking similarity . I had heard mixed reviews of this particular film , but i must say i found it at all times intriguing and it even raised a few hairs on my head and gave me a few shivers , something that does n't happen much these days , i think any negativity surrounding the film can only be attributed to its pacing , which to my eyes is perfection but to modern audiences it will be seen as deathly slow . Plenty of time is given , even within its brief 40 minutes running time , for character development and plot expansion and i must say its a new favourite of mine and certainly one of the better films of the decade .
This movie was a classic . I would have to say that this movie caught the best of a working man who learns from his mistakes . if we could all get along and learn the way everyone in this movie did . It had an important part of showing how family is an important part of life , and how pride can cause you to lose something important in life if we can not find a `` BIG THROAT '' and swallow are pride .
I do n't think I could have enjoyed it more , though certain things were disturbing . I 'm not going to say what , if you have n't seen it ... you 'll have to find out for yourself . At any rate , what movie can lack with Robert Downey Jr. 's puppy-dog eyes ? All-in-all , the plot was developed sufficiently . Nothing seemed too rushed , as movies like this tend to be . The characters were like-able , and there were plenty of hilarious scenes in it . The idea over-all is that the story is very well tied together , even if certain aspects may be unsatisfactory ... by matter of opinion . But like I said before , it 's hard not to love any movie with Robert Downey Jr .
This film is exactly what its title describes -- an attempt to get you to buy into what the writers have to offer . First , it 's kinda fun to see the 1996-style Toronto I remember with all its silly haircuts , sunglasses , clothes , and attitude . It really has n't changed any ; just a nice , safe , cheap , provincial little urban backwater that makes a great meeting place for international film types ! It 's also amusing to see Kenny and Spenny head to L.A. and find out that it 's Toronto all over again , only with a strange assortment of beach bums , musicians , fortune tellers , and yet more uppity film types . I do n't see Pitch as a film to be enjoyed ; it 's not entertainment unless the viewer enjoys watching someone 's aspirations being trampled . I take Pitch as a warning that power and money is really held by studio execs and production houses . Would-be ( and `` successful '' ) writers , musicians , and actors are still mere transients even when they reach the Big Time . So , Kenny and Spenny are trying to sell you a warning . Buy it or do n't , but the message is still there .
One piece of trivia that is often forgotten about this family film is one of business . At the time , in 1994 , this movie held the record for the biggest movie premiere in motion picture history ( and may continue to hold ) . It was held in Pittsburgh , Pennsylvania - no doubt in honor of the original film 's `` Angels '' who `` haunted '' the Pittsburgh Pirates . In this remake they `` haunt '' the California Angels . Anyway , the premiere was held at the long gone Three Rivers Stadium which was the home of the Pittsburgh Pirates and the Pittsburgh Steelers at the time ( the Pirates are now housed in PNC Park and the Steelers at Heinz Field ) . The premiere was held on a movie screen that was five stories in height inside the stadium and held ( and may even continue to hold ) the record for the largest movie premiere in history , shown to 60,000 fans . Danny Glover , Tony Danza and Christopher Lloyd were all in attendance to the admiration of thousands of sports fans .
some people think that the second series was where scooby was ruined..i disagree totally.the shows quality did not go up or down and scrappy , win my opinion , as a very good chrecter.i looked at a poll on jumpedtheshark.com and 72 % of people said scrappys second series was scoobys downfall.OK so loads said yes but 28 % still cant be wrong.I do like the way most of the episodes focused on comedy.i believe the show would have gone rubbish if it was the same 5 people/dog solving mystery in same formula.scrappy was a breath of fresh air to the show.sure , some people tuned out but when scrappy was introduced viewing figures DOUBLED.Back to the show.All the episodes and segments were very funny.i was Intriguded by the yabba shorts and .But at the end of the day its a matter of opinion if you like scrappy or not is a matter of opinion , there is certainly no fact involved.But in my OPINION this was a superb series that gave a beginning to tire show a new formula and lease of life.Nuff said .
If your idea of a thriller is car chases , explosions , and dozens of people being mowed down by gunfire , then `` House of Games '' is definitely not the movie for you . If you like and appreciate psychological drama and suspense , then , by all means , see it . `` House of Games '' tells the story of an esteemed psychologist and writer , Dr. Margaret Ford ( Lindsay Crouse ) , who tries to help a patient and gets involved in the shadowy world of con men led by the charismatic Mike ( Joe Mantegna ) . To say anything more about the plot would ruin the suspense . Frankly , I find it hard to believe anyone who says they saw the twists coming . Just like a clever con artist , this movie draws you into its web and lulls your vigilance . The story is taut and well-crafted , the dialogue smart and laconic , the acting uniformly good ( Mantegna is superbly charismatic ) . Some have complained that Dr. Ford is not a very sympathetic character , and wondered why Mamet would make Lindsay Crouse look so physically unattractive . But Dr. Ford is supposed to be cold and aloof ; moreover , her homeliness is in a way essential to the plot ( at one point , I believe that an injury to her sexual self-esteem is a key part of her motivation ... I 'll say no more ) . `` House of Games '' is a dark look at the underside of human nature that concludes on a note of discomforting ambiguity . It will hold your attention every second while you are watching , and stay with you for a long time afterwards .
This is an excellent stand-up DVD ! Eddie Izzard is the funniest person I have seen in years . His routine is hilarious and makes for great conversation with others who have seen it . I HIGHLY recommend this one . The part about the history of Europe is a bit slow , but the ending jokes in French are quite good , because you do n't have to speak French to get it ( although if you do , it is still hilarious ) . Also , the parts about being a transvestite are quite good . The first scene ( about San Francisco ) is not great , but funny the first time . Skip over those if you can . It 's almost not worth watching . However , this really is a funny , funny stand-up show that everyone should see . `` I was dead at the time ! ''
In the rapid economic development of 1990 's in China , there is a resurgence of traditional Chinese culture , partially due to the rise of nationalism accompanied by the increase in wealth , and more importantly , due to the sense of spiritual belonging after the collapse of the old socialist ideology in the post Cultural-Revolutionary era . However , the resurgence of Chinese traditional culture , namely , the Confucianism , was not without disasters , because Chinese are adopted the entire tradition without eliminating the bad part , and the discrimination against girls demonstrated in this film is an excellent example . Moreover , not only the part that should be discarded were inherited , the good part that was supposed to be inherited , such as the traditional opera , and its technique , such as changing face , was ignored in the resurgence , and facing extinction . The director used this film to criticize the problem of re-embracing tradition by contemporary China and this is the deeper meaning behind the movie .
Prix de Beauté was made on the cusp of the changeover from silence to sound , which came a little later in Europe than in Hollywood . Originally conceived as a silent , it was released with a dubbed soundtrack in France , with a French actress speaking Louise Brooks ' lines , but was released as a silent in Italy and other parts of Europe . I was lucky enough to see the Cineteca di Bologna 's flawless new restoration of an Italian silent print at the Tribeca Film Festival . I have n't seen the talkie version yet , but I think it 's safe to assume the silent version is much more satisfying , since by all reports the dubbing is poorly done ( Louise Brooks is clearly speaking English , so there 's no way her lips could be matched . ) Also , the film is made entirely in the silent style , with few titles and little need for dialogue . Prix de Beauté tells its story visually , with exciting , imaginative camera-work . The opening is instantly kinetic , with rapidly-cut scenes of urban life and swimmers splashing at a public beach . Throughout the film there is an emphasis on visual detail , on clothing , machinery , decoration , and symbolic images such as a caged bird , a heap of torn photographs , a diamond bracelet . This is silent film technique at its pinnacle . Louise Brooks , of course , is responsible for saving the film from obscurity . Seeing this makes it only more heartbreaking to reflect that this was her last starring role . Lustrously beautiful , she dominates the film with her charisma and also gives a perfectly natural yet highly charged performance . Her role here , more than in the Pabst films for which she 's best known , is a woman we can fully understand and sympathize with . She plays Lucienne Garnier , a typist with a possessive fiancé , who yearns to get more out of life and secretly enters a beauty contest , with immediate success . She is then torn between the excitement of her glamorous new life and her love for the man who insists she give it all up or lose him . All of the characters are drawn with nuance . The fiancé inspires pity and is not merely a brute : he loves Lucienne , but is a limited man who ca n't cope with her having a life apart from him or attracting the attentions of other men . Even the `` other man '' in the story is not the simple slimeball we first take him for , though his intentions may be just as possessive as the fiancé 's . *************************WARNING : SPOILERS BELOW***************** The film has many fine set pieces , including Lucienne 's triumph in the `` Miss Europe '' contest , shown through the comic reactions of assorted audience members , who wind up pelting the heroine with flowers ; her misery as a housewife , peeling potatoes while the pendulum of the cuckoo clock marks time behind her ; a nightmarish trip to a fun-fair ( in the silent version , this occurs late in the film , after her marriage ) at which Lucienne , crushed among the low-lifes and depressed by her husband 's macho antics , decides that she ca n't go on with her present existence ; and especially the final scene in the projection room where she views her talkie screen test . Louise Brooks may never have looked more beautiful than she does here , with the projector 's beam flickering on her alabaster profile , her shoulders swathed in white fur , her face incandescent under the black helmet of hair as she watches herself singing on screen . The double shot of her exquisite corpse and her still-living image on the screen is particularly poignant : Louise Brooks ' image , like Lucienne 's , remains immortal despite her frustratingly aborted film career .
Superman and the Mole Men is quite possibly Superman 's toughest adventures ever . Lois Lane and Clark Kent are sent to Silsby , home of the world 's deepest oil well . While there , some radioactive mole men come up through the oil well and explore the town . Jeff Corey and many other townspeople try to dispose of the invading mole men . Can Superman change the people 's ways in time to save the mole men ? Can Superman warn the people in time about the radioactive danger the mole men bring ? In my opinion , Superman and the Mole Men is a very intelligent , well-written and well-acted movie . Even though we only get to see Superman fly once briefly , It still makes a great Superman adventure . A must see for anyone . 10/10 Stars
Buster absolutely shines in this episode , which is the only vehicle I 've seen towards the end of the career that allowed him to do the physical ( and silent ! ) comedy that made him famous . It 's still a shock to hear his gravelly voice in the talkie sequences - his voice is about the only thing I do n't care for , as far as Buster is concerned - but his ability to take a pratfall is still unparalleled . He even repeats some of the gags used in his early two-reelers with Roscoe Arbuckle . My deepest gratitude to Rod Serling for presenting us with this episode , and for giving Buster 's genius full scope . He did n't have much time ( one episode ) to do it in , but this is a touching tribute to Hollywood 's greatest genius .
Jason Bourne sits in a dusty room in with blood on his hands , trying to make sense of what he 's just done . Meanwhile , a CIA chief in NYC outlines the agency 's response to what 's just happened on screen . An American flag stands proudly on the centre of his desk in the foreground of the shot , but as he speaks , it slips out of focus as his plan veers into morally dubious territory , as if it does n't want to be associated with the course of action the government man decides is necessary in the interests of national security . This shot effectively captures the mood of the film . As well as portraying Bourne 's quest to find out how he became Jason Bourne , Ultimatum is also an examination of the human costs of the measures taken to protect us in the interests of stability and security . It is also probably the best film you 'll see in the cinema this year . It 's just so intense . Bourne says to Simon Ross ( Considine ) `` This is n't some newspaper story , this is real '' and in the audience you almost believe him . The camera shakes , but remains steady enough for you to see everything and feel like you 're there with Bourne as he tries to elude his pursuers , and the performances are so good that these guys seem as though they are the characters they 're portraying , instead of just being actors performing well-written roles . The action scenes are so brutally fast-paced and well choreographed that they seem instinctive instead of planned to the minutest movement ; the stunt-work is nothing short of amazing . The pacing is just incredible . It keeps driving forward towards its conclusion , but not so fast that it leaves you struggling to piece together the plot ; the script delivers the information you need as quickly and clearly as possible before moving on to the next tense action set-piece . While they 're often simple ( the Waterloo sequence is essentially just a man on a phone being watched by a man on a phone ) they 're charged with such dramatic intensity that you ca n't take your eyes off them . The film is just so focused on powering forwards that you ca n't help being swept along by it . With its intense action set-pieces , brilliantly paced storyline , and intelligent examination of the decisions made in the name of national security , the Bourne series is one that accurately captures the ambiguities of our age . Ultimatum is its peak .
It 's a short movie from David Lynch with just 8 minutes , but it got all the `` Lynchian ingredients '' ! It 's mysterious , dark , inconclusive , eerie , and strange ; and before the blond girl starts to talk it 's even a bit scary ! The soundtrack is exceptional to create this odd atmosphere because it 's also sinister and mysterious About the setting itself , it has n't the `` traditional '' red curtains , but it has socking purple painted walls , which give it an equally effect of eeriness . The plot is about a girl who 's locked in a dark room and she cries for help ; then comes another girl who starts talking to her in a mysterious way , saying she 's there just because of her fault We do n't know what did happen or what will happen next it ended unsolved and puzzling , as a good Lynch movie must end ! It 's a great short , despite some amateurish acting . The girls are professional actresses , but I think their acting could have been better in this short .
It 's great how this movie pulls you along . I had honest laughs . Do n't care that it 's low budget cause the thing works for me . To be honest my wife did n't really go for it in the same way but she prefers a different type of film . She did admit though that it was very creative and well put together and probably all on a shoe string . These characters who 's lives are strange and troubled give me something to relate to in my own world . Just keep going and be who you are . Dreams are what you make of them . In watching this movie a second and third time I realized that there are some hidden moments that passed by me on the first time through . What can I say , I like my fun with some complexity . Anyway liked it . Hope to see more .
Eddie Murphy plays Chandler Jarrell , a man who devotes his time to finding lost children . When the beautiful Kee Nang { Charlotte Lewis } enters his life , she tells him he is the chosen one and he must find the Golden Child . Sceptical and driven purely by lust and intrigue , Jarrell gets involved without realising he 's about to embark on a fantastical journey , one that involves peril and worst of all , the demon Sardo Numspa . Is The Golden Child a product of its time ? , by that i mean , was Eddie Murphy and The Golden Child 's popularity exclusive to the late 1980s audiences ? . For i can remember vividly how much this film entertained folk back in that decade , it 's box office was $ 79,817,937 , making it the 8th biggest earner of 1986 , but since the 80s faded from memory it has become the in thing to deny Eddie Murphy pictures the comedy accolades that they actually once had . The Golden Child is not up with the more accepted 80s Murphy pictures like Trading Places and Beverly Hills Cop , but upon revisiting the film recently i personally find that it contains Murphy at his wisecracking , quipping and charming best ! , seriously ! . Cashing in on a fantasy action formula that was reinvigorated and temp-lated by Raiders Of The Lost Ark in 1981 , The Golden Child hits all the required genre buttons . Pretty girl , daring reluctant-hero with a quip in his armoury , dashing villain { Charles Dance so English i could kiss him myself } , wonderful colour , and a cute kid with mystical powers , the film only asks you to get involved in the fun , not to dissect and digress its worth as a cranial fantasy picture . Yes the CGI demon looks creaky now , and yes the genre had far better pictures in the 80s , 90s and beyond , but really if you agree with the disgraceful rating of 5 here on this site then you may just be taking this genre a little too serious , seriously . 7/10
This is a comedy of morals , so occasionally a gentle touch of bitterness occurs , but a lightness soften all sarcasm and irony flows till all of a sudden one moment will halt your heart and changes everything . This film , marvelously written and directed , is a gem that shines perfectly , with beautiful acting by all . Jean-Louis Trintignant is exquisite as usual , and Romy Schneider is a pearl , perfect and glowing , that is not to be missed . A truly wonderful film ! !
While Rome goes mad celebrating Hitler 's visit - uniforms , bands , parades - two outsiders stay home , in a large building , and wind up meeting . She is Sofia Loren , who is the wife of brutish public servant and mother of six children . He is Mastroianni , a radio speaker who 's been fired because of his homosexuality . Both of them need company and understanding , both f them find it in each other . The movie covers a span of a few hours . The color are faded and everything takes place with a sound track of military marches and hysterical radio announcers . Strangely enough , the Nazi anthem - the Horst-Wessel-Lied - ends up becoming a romantic musical theme . Beautiful movie , excellent recreation of a special era in Italian history and a touching , sad story . Mastroianni is as good as we have come to expect and Sofia Loren does a superb job , very far away from her usual truck driver 's pin-up , Neapolitan fishwife personas . Do n't miss it .
This film Evil Breed : The legend of samhain contains very little thought or effort . It is ridiculed with specs of ultra fast `` slasher '' style death and plain disgusting acts of death . The acting was rated a D as the actors show very little ability , and the stupidity of them in the film is too questionable . The way they portrayed what people their ages act like was incredibly different . The odd split of porn is fit in thought it really does n't offer much , and any area that is respectable but is quite quickly run down with absolute gut wrenching death . Example is the poor fellow whom is disemboweled from his anus , and the scene lasts for about 5 minutes . It is terribly obvious of how little of a fight the kids put up . This film is a good choice for someone who likes to watch some awful deaths and practically torture .
This is my favorite of the older Tom & Jerry cartoons from the early 40 's . The original version with Mammy Two Shoes is on the Tom & Jerry Spotlight Collection 2 set , disc one , and showcases the wonderful detailed animation of the early cartoons . The gags on this one are n't all madcap Avery style , but more subtle and aimed at anyone who 's ever stayed up late watching scary movies ( or radio programs ) ! Tom is listening to a creepy radio show , and Jerry decides to play a number of tricks to spook him . The nine-lives gag is well done here , and I do n't know how many times I tried to make a vacuum and a sheet that scary when I was a kid . When Tom 's owner is awakened by the ruckus- Mammy was NOT the maid , it was HER house- she gets one heck of a surprise , with a big laugh . Get your pause button ready , it 's worth it !
This stylistically sophisticated visual game presents a story within a story ' . The protagonist is scriptwriter Bart Klever who fights persistently with his new text  which is , at the same time , the screenplay of the film we 're watching . In the movie Bart plays a scriptwriter writing the script of the film Bart 's struggle with the text becomes a narrative theme , as does the environment of the flat where he works and takes care of his little girl . The intimate environment offers ample opportunity for games of illusion involving space , light , colours and a couple of cats . The outwardly simple world of the room is further complicated by the unstable dimensions of a text continually influenced by the filmmaker 's interventions , which appears on a computer monitor and serves as a counterpoint to the similarity mutable environment . The constantly changing viewing angle complicates answers to questions which arise : What is truth ' and what illusion ' ? Which of the observed worlds is primary and superior to the rest ? Can anything serve as a basic orientation point in the narrative space ?
In what is a truly diverse cast , this show hits it 's stride on FOX . It is the kind of sitcom that grows on you . If you just watch 1 show you might not like it much , but once you watch two or three- you get hooked . This is because some of the jokes hit & some miss depending upon how you view them . As is usual today , the themes are very mature . The humor is usually very mature too . Often the most funny parts are the parts where the mature themes collide with the innocent ones . Red ( Kurtwood Smith ) a veteran actor does some very good deadpan type of humor on this show . Debra Jo Rupp plays well in this ensemble cast too . Danny Masterson , the oldest actor of the `` kids '' is very good too . Laura Prepon ( Donna ) looks better in the earlier shows as a natural redhead ( who got the idea of making her a blonde ? ) . She shows very good talent & comedic timing often . She looks good without make up too . This is one of the better entries on FOX in the sitcom department & it 's most successful live action one since Married With Children
I just came back from the Montreal premiere of Zero Day ... and i 'm surprised as hell to find a negative comment on the movie . Basically the blame is about Coccio doing an easy and overplayed social message ... well , Mr-I'm-a-reviewer , it 's an easy and overplayed critic of movies with a social charge . Not that I want to expose my life here , but I come from a small town with a similar school than these guys go . Reject & ignorance on the menu . Thing is ... I understand how can young kids can be driven to do such horror . High schools have became battle fields of conformity . It 's a real ugly sight . You need to fight your way into being like the others . It 's hard to explain , bit a lot of people dose n't realize that high schools are becoming cemeteries of human intelligence . Meanwhile , parents are closing their eyes and smiling about how their life in their comfortable suburb is perfect . The real motive of the movie is n't about what is driving them . It 's about this death-like calm suburb and everybody closing their eyes and trying to create this atmosphere of a perfect town . Cal expressed it well . It 's a wake up call . Drama is everywhere and it can take every shape . In that case little dramas ( like Andre being called a faggot for wearing a J.C Penny shirt ) are shaping into being the worse nightmare of a whole town . Andre & Cal took the most extreme way to express their pain . The malaise of unconformity in an era where you need more than ever to be like the others to be accepted . I like particularly the last scenes where some guys are burning the crosses of Andre & Cal , like if with the pain they communicated , Cal & Andre have communicated their blind rage to their community , their refusal to think about the causes of some acts . It might seemed aggressive as a movie , but Coccio is meditating more than whining or enunciating . What Andre & Cal are living is a reality ... and a scary one that might get to other kids . Disturbing movie ... Home making and strong feeling made Ben Coccio do a very very disturbing movie .
Riget II is a good sequel , but not quite as good as the first one . This series do n't seem to be quite as serious as the first one . There are much more comedy in this , good one , though . We 're back at the Danish Rigshospitalet , the Danish national hospital . Mrs. Drusse is just about to leave the hospital as her work is done , but fate want 's it otherwise . She is soon chasing ghosts and Helmer is doing everyone mad and it 's soon to get much worse as black powers are unleashed in the Kingdom . This story involves a lot more comedy that the previous . By all means lot of fun , but it makes you take the series a little less serious . The story has kept a lot of elements from the last series and added some new ones . It 's well written , but some of the new elements are just kind of silly , but they save it by making it more like a comedy . Good story , but not as good , original and thrilling as the first series . The actors are the same with some addition to the regular cast . They are all very good . It 's an odd story and setting . Some parts are a total freak show and the characters change during the show so to keep it serious and keep it real is not an easy job . Yet , these actors handle this whole situation perfectly . Much of the good qualities from the first series are kept intact . The cinematography is one of those qualities . The hand-held camera that made Trier world famous gives suspense and reality to the series . It gives the camera a unique ability to move and follow the characters and Trier makes use of these abilities . Good , movement , great lightning and good composition and editing makes this enjoyable to watch . Be prepare to see better effect in this sequel that in the first . Also be prepared to see some more . I did n't think that green thing looked all too good . Thought it was unoriginal and did n't fit . Never the less , the effects like the ghosts are really good . The non-digital effects looks good too . Little Brother looks just really odd , but you accept it . All over I 'd say effects are from OK to good . The music is also quite good . Moody and nice . Some of it are really touching . It fits really nice . As the first one there are rather little music in the action scenes and it works very well . All together this makes a good sequel . If you 'd seen Riget you can see this one without being disappointed . It has many of the same qualities as the first series . However , I would recommend seeing the first series before seeing this . These two makes up a series you do n't wan na miss .
This is a very rare example of a movie about transvestitism ( of heterosexuals ) . The film treats the taboo theme so that even a general audience not knowing of transvestitism at all will strongly sympathize with its main character . Adrian Pasdar is very believable as Gerald/Geraldine and shall not be forgot for this brillant acting . The directing of Christopher Monger is very sensitively , treating such a difficult issue quite excellently , packed into a good story . Not a big movie , neither an `` art '' film , but a little , lovely motion picture !
Babyface - Notorious Barbara Stanwyck flick where she is told by the local professor type that she has power- he tries to get her to read Nietzche- she says books ai n't never done her no good.Soon we find out her father is basically pimping her out to a local politico and others.Finally she has had enough and relocates to the big city.We follow her trail of men up the ladder of success in an international bank.The dialogue is quite saucy for it 's time and it was one the last films to come out before the self inflicted Hollywood production code.Look for a cameo by a young John Wayne as one of Stanwyck 's willing victims.Part of the Forbidden Hollywood collection - I watched the extended version- the DVD has both versions plus Red-Headed Woman and Waterloo Bridge.An interesting movie and foreshadowing for future femme fatale roles that Stanwyck would play in the era of film noir . B+
I absolutely LOVED this film ! I do not at all relate to all the other comments I have read about it . I was COMPLETELY enthralled through every second ! I found the story gripping , the acting intense , and the direction spot-on . I would literally jump every time the phone would ring close to the end of the movie . Even though there was nothing `` scary '' about the story itself , I was soundly on edge through the whole movie - and for the rest of my evening . I found that there were so many perfect choices made ... the casting , the script , the little bits of humor sprinkled in it . There were so many points where the film could 've gone for the cheap thrill , but it never did , and that for me put this movie above so many of the mediocre thrillers that have come out lately ... and for the last number of years .
Robert De Niro , Cuba Gooding Jr. , Hal Holbrook , and all the rest of the actors and actresses in `` Men of Honour '' have combined to make this a fine movie . Mark Isham wrote the filmscore , so you know the music is truly fine , too . But : After noticing a slew of goofs , loopholes , and over-dramatic heart-string pluckings right from the start , I had to make a vow to ignore them and sit back to enjoy the film . If you can do that , it _really_is_ good . The story of Carl Brashear , a true-to-life hero , is inspirational enough to last a lifetime . Look him up on the internet ... The entire story is more amazing than the film , as the Director admitted in his comments . There were only three African-American U.S. Navy divers in World War II . However , none reached the status of U.S. Navy Master Diver . Carl Brashear was THE first African-American U.S. Navy Master Diver . AND he was the first amputee diver to ever be certified or recertified as a U.S. Navy diver . ( Resounding Applause ) . On the negative side of the movie 's ledger : Should I tell you of only one of the many `` loopholes '' ? Yeah , I 'll mark this comment as containing `` spoilers '' and do so ... The early , pivotal scene where the helicopter hits the radio mast and sinks into the sea : They 'd never have had the time to suit up a full Mark V diver , even if he were the legendary Master Chief Billy Sunday , in time to be only `` ... a couple of minutes late '' saving the pilot . So , for loopholes , goofs , and over-dramatization , I derated `` Men of Honor '' from a perfect 10 down to a 7 . Will Hollywood EVER realize that the unalloyed truth is so much better that their over-dramatic approach to story-telling ? I doubt it . Too bad !
Wow , I forgot how great this movie was until I stumbled upon it while looking through the garage . It 's a kind of strange combination of a bio of Michael Jackson , a collection of musical vignettes , and a story about a super hero fighting to save some little kids . The vignettes are good ( especially Speed Demon ) , but the best part of this movie is the super hero segment , in which Michael Jackson turns into a car , a robot , and finally a spaceship ( and it 's just as weird as it sounds ) . Joe Pesci is hilarious , and has enough cool imagery and great music to entertain throughout ! The real gem however is the incredible `` Smooth Criminal '' video , which makes the movie worth owning for that part alone !
As a horse lover one can only appreciate this movie . There are few movies that show horsemanship as this one does . I would love to know if Brian does his own riding in the film . Would also like to know if he enjoys horses . Brian has been in a lot of movies where he has ridden . Where did he learn to ride ? The only part that is hard for me to take is that the riding scenes are always full tilt , like a horse can run forever at full steam . The camera-work is first rate and captures the horses in a way that shows how dangerous things can be on top of a horse . It would be very interesting to know how they went about casting this movie to find all of the very good horseback riders .
Before I comment about this movie , you should realize that when I saw this movie , I expected the typical crap , horror , B-movie and just wanted to have fun . Jack Frost is one that not only delivers but is actually one of the best that I 've seen in a long time . Scott McDonald is great as Jack Frost , in fact I think he has a future in being psychopaths in big time movies if ever given the chance . McDonald is a serial killer who becomes a snowman through some stupid accidental mix of ridiculous elements . As soon as that snowman starts moving around and killing people , though , you will find it hard not to laugh . The lines that are said are completely retarded but really funny . The fact that the rest of the cast completely over-acts just adds to stupidity of the film , but it 's stupidity is it 's genius . The scene where the snowman is with the teenage girl is truly classic in B-movie , horror film fashion . I truly hope there is a sequel and I 'll be right there to watch it on whatever cable channel does it . Of course it 's only fun to watch the first few times and it 's not exactly a good work of motion picture technology , but I just like to see snowmen kill people . I gave it a 7 out of 10 , this is a great movie for dates and couples in the late hours .
This movie scared heck out of me when I was just a kid . It 's no `` Citizen Kane '' but it has its moments . The arm ripping scene is good . The plot is good even if characters are n't - could have something to do with the acting . Put some top name people in the roles and then see what you get . This was one of those shoot , edit ( what little there was ) and distribute in a couple of months type of movies . This is classic low budget sci-fi and deserves it just due . I rated it a 9 based other films of this genre and age .
Despite Louis B. Mayer reportedly not being interested in signing the young Greta Garbo to a contract , this first American and MGM film for the actress looked quite beautiful . It 's obvious that the film was assigned some amazing talent to film the production and make matte paintings , as it has all the nice polish and artfulness you 'd expect from the best pictures the studio could produce . It simply looks beautiful -- even 84 years later . As for Garbo herself , like her other very early American films she , too , looks different . While she 's quite recognizable , her makeup is much softer than it would become just a year later -- giving her a less severe look and a gentleness about her you just did n't see in subsequent films . I kind of wish they 'd kept this look , but considering how famous she 'd become with the trademark look , who am I to say they should n't have gone that route ? ! The film is about Garbo and how she and her family are unfairly forced off their land by the landlord . While the landlady , the much esteemed Doña Bernarda , claims it 's because the bank has demanded payment , it 's because her son has fallen for Garbo -- and what better way to get rid of her than to force them out on the streets ! Nice lady , huh ? ! Years pass and by now Garbo has become a new singing sensation who is world-famous . When she returns to her hometown years later , her old boyfriend ( who HAD promised to marry her but wimped out when his mother , Doña Bernarda , refused to allow it ) sees her . His new love for another lady is now tested -- will he be content to marry this lady who is the heir to a huge pig fortune or will he want his old flame ? And , more importantly , will Garbo even take him back after he behaved so spinelessly ? In the meantime , a huge rainstorm hits . The land begins to flood and homes soon are being washed away by the deluge . Cortez and a friend make a mad dash as the dam breaks ! In a scene where they obviously superimposed his row boat over the cascading stream , he eventually makes it out alive and to the home where Garbo is now staying . She welcomes them inside and they stay with her until the storm passes . Then , he admits that he still loves her and had braved the storm to make sure that she was safe . She tells him to get lost ! Next , you see Ricardo about to get married to his second choice , the daughter of the Pork King . He obviously has little enthusiasm for this -- and you feel sorry for the lady , as she did nothing wrong . Soon , Cortez is seen wandering back to Garbo 's home -- he 's love-sick and needs her . In this scene , Garbo is quite luminous and ca n't tell him to leave -- as they dissolve in each other 's arms . Once again , he tells her of his love for her . When Doña Bernarda learns of this , she is not pleased . Evidently , a Pork Queen is a better catch than an internationally known singer . Because of the meddling of this nasty old lady , Garbo leaves -- unwilling to come between the mother and her wimpy son . But , Cortez comes running -- announcing he MUST have her and wo n't rest until he has her as his wife . Moments after making this proclamation , a family friend talks to Cortez and convinces him to give her up for the good of his career and reputation . So much for `` wo n't rest until he has her for his wife '' , huh ? ! Despite Cortez being a wimp through and through , for some reason she can not bring herself to hate him . And so , he marries the Pork Queen and lives a very dull life . When years later Garbo meets Cortez again , he is a dull looking middle-aged man -- while she is as beautiful as ever . And , not surprisingly , she tells him , once again , to get lost . At the time this film was made , Garbo was not a star in the US and Cortez was . So , in light of this , it 's surprising they gave Cortez such an unlikable character to play . Instead of the usual confident Valentino-like role they 'd been giving him , here he is an indecisive wimp -- a HUGE wimp . And , from here on , his career was on a slow downward spiral . As for Garbo , the role helped establish her as a big star -- as she was THE focus of the film and played a character much like her later personas . As for the film , the new music composed for it was very nice , though a tad repetitive . The print , oddly , was nearly perfect throughout except for the intertitle cards -- which could use some restoration . A most enjoyable film -- expertly constructed , wistful and worth seeing . And , for one of the few times I can think of it , I have no real complaints in this excellent film .
Saw this a couple times on the Sundance Channel several years ago and received a nice cinematic jolt to the system . A semi-surreal yet hard edged take on modern media culture ( or the lack of it ) , focusing on some seriously wacked , way-beyond-the-Hollywood-fringe dwellers . It had an amusing early performance from Mark Ruffalo , and some memorable cinematography from the DP who did the Polish Brothers movies . There was a savage umcompromising humor and a weirdly original feel to it that definitely set it apart . This film had cult classic written all over it , and I 'm surprised it 's not yet out on DVD . Hopefully soon .
This movie is just so good ! Despite Carmen Electra , this has to be one of the better films I have seen in awhile . Jamie Kennedy is just amazing , and Loren Dean plays an insane spoiled movie star very well . The plot is great as well . It 's all very real which is scary . It says here that it 's a drama , but this is one of the damn funniest dramas I have ever seen . Go check it out .
The dazzling seventeen-minute dance sequence of George Gershwin 's 1928 orchestral piece , `` An American in Paris '' , is an indisputable masterwork . Choreographed with precision and unparalleled flair by Gene Kelly , the vibrant combination of color , music and dance is still eye-poppingly startling as the piece is broken down into scenes inspired by selected master artists - Dufy in the opening Place de la Concorde piece , Manet in the flower market , Utrillo in a Paris street , Rousseau at the fair , Vincent Van Gogh in the spectacular Place de l'Opera piece , and Toulouse-Lautrec for the Moulin Rouge where Kelly wears his famous white bodysuit . The 97 minutes that precede this finale are not as exciting , not by a long shot , but there are certain charms to be had in viewing the entire 1951 Oscar-winning musical . Director Vincente Minnelli and screenwriter Alan Jay Lerner have fashioned a surprisingly sophisticated if rather slight romantic story focused on Jerry Mulligan , a former G.I . who has remained in Paris after the end of WWII trying to make a living as a painter . With his braggadocio manner and athletic dancing style , Gene Kelly can be concurrently ingratiating and irritating as a screen personality , but he seems to find his oeuvre as the carefree Jerry . The love-triangle plot is focused on Jerry 's involvement with Milo Roberts , a self-proclaimed art patron but a sexual predator when it comes to young artists . On their first date in a crowded Montmartre nightclub , Jerry unapologetically falls for Lise , a young woman who turns out to be the fiancée of Henri , a professional entertainer and friend of Jerry 's pal , Adam , an out-of-work concert pianist . Romantic complications ensue until the inevitable ending but not before several classic Gershwin songs are performed . The best of these is the most imitated - a swooningly romantic song and dance to `` Our Love Is Here to Stay '' along a faux-Seine River in a blue hazy mist with yellow fog lights . The way Kelly and Leslie Caron circle each other is transcendent as they approach each other tentatively at first and then synchronize beautifully to the music leading to the final clinch . Few films have so elegantly and succinctly shown two people falling in love . `` I Got Rhythm '' and `` S'Wonderful '' spotlight Kelly 's nimble tap-dancing and agreeable singing , while `` Embraceable You '' is danced impressively by Caron in a five-scene montage of Henri 's all-over-the-map description of Lise to Adam . Designed to show off Caron 's dancing versatility , the sequence is similar to the one in `` On the Town '' where Vera-Ellen showed off her considerable dancing skills when Kelly 's sailor character described his multi-faceted vision of Miss Turnstiles . As Lise , the nineteen year-old Caron ( in her first film ) dances superbly throughout and handles her role with unformed charm with her acting talent not to bloom for several years . Looking quite glamorous , Nina Foch plays older as the manipulative Milo and manages to be likable enough for us to care about her fate , while Oscar Levant is just his sardonic self as Adam . Performing an elegant `` I 'll Build a Stairway to Paradise '' , George Guétary plays Henri so agreeably that you feel bad that he does lose the girl at the end . This is not the best all-around MGM musical , but there is certainly enough movie magic to make this quite worthwhile . The 2000 DVD contains a fairly pristine print but little else in terms of extras .
A MUST SEE ! I saw WHIPPED at a press screening and it was hilarious . We 're talking nonstop laughs . It makes SOMETHING ABOUT MARY seem like a meandering drama . Amanda Peet screams star quality with her winning combination of beauty , brains , and serious acting ability . Peter Cohen , the director , has made a cutting edge film that shows the raw inside of men 's egos in the urban dating world . For all of it 's comedy , Whipped succeeds with it 's intelligence . Which is so rare for a first time director , especially with a romantic comedy . He is a major talent . Judah Domke , Brian Van Holt , Jonathan Abrahams , and Zorie Barber round out the cast with depth and very strong performances as the would be slick lady 's men . You 've got to see these guys go to work and get caught in Peet 's web . Check out the trailer on whipped.com , it 's worth the 3 minute download .
Small SPOILERS alert ! ! ! Good movie ... VERY good movie . And I 'm surprised to say that myself , because I 'm not a big fan of vampires and the sound of the director 's name Deran Serafian usually means bad news . Most of his films are below average action movies like Death Warrant and Gunmen . This was one of his first films and maybe he should have continued making horror movies instead of action . This movie really fascinated me . Good accomplishment , seeing no famous actors or big budget was involved . It really is the story that keeps you focused . Especially fans of the original Dracula myth will be satisfied . Sarafian lights up another aspect of the famous Bram Stoker story and remains rather loyal and true to the truth . It explains the life of the Roemenian Count Dracula and how he scared the Turkish army away by spearing dead corpses in front of his castle . Of course , that 's where the reality and the `` based on a true story '' stops . The blood drinking and stuff all was invented by Bram Stoker . In this movie , the count ( Vlad Teppish ) emigrates to the USA and seduces tons of woman . And they 're all pretty girls , I 'll give him that . Overall , good acting by unknown faces , enough blood and gore to satisfy the more morbid horror fans and an interesting storyline . This film is really unknown and it was hidden on the darkest shelf at my local videostore . But it certainly is worth cleaning up the dust on the cover and put it in the VCR . Heck , it 's a lot better than the famous Nicole Kidman movie with the same title . These two films have nothing else in common , but I blame that movie for stealing the attention away from this nice little picture . Check it out ... my humble opinion on To Die For = 8.5/10
I saw this film at the Taos Film Festival last year , and was just overwhelmed by it . It 's a rich , warm novel brought to the screen , beautifully acted , and well directed . More than anything , it reminded me of the films of David Lean , both in its ability to handle a complex story , and its knack for creating powerful scenes that affect you on several different levels . The best movie I 've seen in years .
True fans of film will love this authentic movie . I disagree with the trolls who are rating this movie a one-star and calling it unrealistic . While I do n't have the background or come from the environment of the protagonists , I 've spent many years working in lower income and working class neighborhoods and feel the acting was very real and representative of how teenagers behave . I do n't know what the basis is for others ' comments that the film is `` unrealistic '' . The dialog is great . The low budget production value did n't bother me a bit . I felt that the natural lighting enhanced the character of the film . The focus was entirely on the story line and character development and not glitzy Hollywood propping or melodrama . I completely bought into the character 's motivations and reactions . The acting was believable and impressive for new and non-actors . If your idea of good film is Transformers or Fast & Furious , then skip it . If you enjoy good character driven dramas , then see it . ( Regarding the negative commenters being `` trolls '' : click on their names and you will see most have no other reviews or only negative reviews . )
If you 're going to put on a play within the prison walls why not go for the top playwright William Shakespeare ? And if you are going to choose your cast from a whole lot of criminals serving long sentences for the most heinous crimes , you can be sure there will be plenty of time for rehearsals . In a Kentucky Correctional Prison a courageous project such as this was undertaken with amazing results . This film shows how it was all done .the casting .the rehearsals .the set and costumes and the final presentation of Shakespeare 's play `` The Tempest . '' It had not occurred to me before but there is an analogy between the setting of the play and the correctional prison . In the play the ship-wrecked characters are confined to an island with no contact with the outside world . Prison life too is much like that . With a simple painted back drop of a surrounding seascape , the characters in a most pleasing assortment of costumes bellow out their lines to an approving audience , may be not quite as Shakespeare intended but with good heart and true sincerity for sure . More interesting than the play itself were the little cameos of each man behind his character . One inmate saw the play as a lesson in forgiveness another as a redemption of his sins . It was quite moving to see the men wipe away a tear as they spoke of murder , shooting and strangulation . One had the feeling that they would all like to wind back the clock and reconsider their brutal actions . However ( as someone said ) the past was past , and the present was the beginning of a new future . At least the play gave temporary relief from the depressing thoughts of past events . The prison authorities should be applauded for allowing the play to take place . Such an event would put Kentucky on the map and hopefully other prisons might follow their good example . It seems to me that everyone stands to benefit not only the Kentucky prison but the prisoners themselves who need to find new confidence and self esteem and be prepared for the day when they go out on parole .
Back in the day of the big studio system , the darndest casting decisions were made . Good old all American James Stewart appearing as a Hungarian in The Shop Around the Corner . Had I been casting the film , the part of Kralik would have been perfect for Charles Boyer . His accent mixed in with all the other European accents would have been nothing . Stewart had some of the same problem in the Mortal Storm also with Margaret Sullavan . Margaret Sullavan was his most frequent leading lady on the screen , he did four films with her . But is only this one where neither of them dies . Sullavan and her husband Leland Heyward knew Stewart back in the day when he was a struggling player in New York . In fact Sullavan 's husband was Stewart 's good friend Henry Fonda back then . I think only Clark Gable was able to carry off being an American in a cast of non-Americans in Mutiny on the Bounty . Stewart in The Mortal Storm was German , but all the other players were American as well so nothing stood out . But if you can accept Stewart , than you 'll be seeing a fine film from Ernest Lubitsch . The plot is pretty simple , a man and woman working in a department store in Budapest do n't get along in person . But it seems that they are carrying on a correspondence with some anonymous admirers which turn out to be each other . Also employer Frank Morgan suspects Stewart wrongly of kanoodling with his wife . Though the leads are fine and Frank Morgan departs from his usual befuddled self , the two players who come off best are Felix Bressart and Joseph Schildkraut . Bressart has my favorite moments in the film when he takes off after Morgan starts asking people for opinions . He makes himself very scarce . And Joseph Schildkraut , who is always good , is just great as the officious little worm who is constantly kissing up to Frank Morgan . You really hate people like that , I 've known too many like Schildkraut in real life who are at office politics 24 hours a day . Sad that it pays off a good deal of the time .
Another episode from childhood that , as an adult , I look back on with a different perspective . This was one of my favorite childhood episodes , one that really cemented my adoration of this show . However , on viewing this episode after 20 years , I 'd say it is definitely one of the lighter ones , played for laughs and amusement , instead of the dramatic and well-constructed story lines in previous episodes in this , their first and best season . Perhaps this episode was written for a little fan R & R too ! As Mr. Spock would say , the story just is n't logical but there are some amusing lines like , of course , Mr. Spock 's final one at the end -- when he asks the Captain , McCoy et al whether they enjoyed their R & R and they answer in the affirmative , he raises an eyebrow and says `` Fascinating ... '' in only the way Mr. Spock could do that . An interesting story line , of course , the idea of an amusement park being actually amusing ( instead of the fake and often annoying `` amusement '' of Disneyland , for example ) , being able to have one 's wishes actually come true . Really , a great idea but not that well executed . And coming from Theodore Sturgeon , another of the great SF short story writers they used in the first season , one wonders how much tinkering was done to the script that Sturgeon turned in . Now , here is a little trivia I learned on this very site : In 1987 , James Gunn established the Theodore Sturgeon Award for best short science fiction story . And I 'll quote the rest from this site : In 1968 he { Sturgeon } wrote `` The Joy Machine '' , a third script for the Star Trek TV series { Amok Time the other } , that was never shot . The main reason that it was n't used in the series is that it contained expensive special effects sequences that would be too much for their budget . However , the script was adapted into a book by Sci-Fi writer James Gunn ( Star Trek # 80 , The Original Series ) and published by Pocket Books in 1996 . I 'd sum this up to say this episode is still very enjoyable , especially if one does n't think too much about it . Just laugh and enjoy it and next episode we can get back to the serious stuff of protecting the universe .
I had the TV on for a white noise companion and heard '' $ 400 for a fully furnished apartment '' So I ran into the TV room expecting another 70 's flick and got much more . Luckily , I could rewind to the beginning ( DVR buffer ) and hit the record button to watch it entirely . ( Cinemax uncut and in HD no less ! ) Aside from some holes in the story and intermittent improbable dialog/events , this is an effective thriller worthy of your time to watch . Pretty creepy and progressive at times : Beverly D'Angelo 's character masturbates in front of Alison Parker , played adroitly by Cristina Raines , Parker stabs , in very gory fashion , her father , an explicit menage a trios scene . ( do n't let the kids watch ) The film is TOTALLY 70 's full of bad clothes ( polyester suits and tacky ascots ) and decor , bad hair , over bloated music score , and familiar looking cinematography . The cast is excellent , take a second on this film 's home page to check it out.It was a surprise to see Christopher Walken , Jerry Orbach and Jeff Goldblum so young . Sylvia Miles- always wonderfully creepy ! ENJOY !
An Insomniac 's Nightmare was an incredibly interesting , well-made film . I loved the way it just throws you into the main character 's subconscious without coddling the viewer ... the acting was top notch - honestly , I would watch Dominic Monaghan read the phone book ! - but everyone else , especially the young girl , was great as well . I was very impressed by the look of the film , too . Usually , `` independent films '' have a grainy , I-shot-this-on-my-camcorder look to them , but this director knows what she 's doing . The lighting , the cinematography ... quality work . I 'm looking forward to a feature-length work from Tess Nanavati !
I absolutely loved this film ! I was hesitant to watch it at first because I thought it would be too painful . I remember how hard it was when John was shot . However , watching the `` Two of Us '' took me back to a happier time when he was still alive and there was hope and possibility . I think that the writer did an amazing job depicting what `` might have been . '' Aidan Quinn was adorable as Paul and met the challenge head on . I was impressed with his accent and mannerisms . Jared Harris is also very talented and was quite believable as John . My favorite parts were the scene in the park and the rooftop scene - which was so poignant . The film left me with both sadness and satisfaction , both of which I feel are appropriate , given the circumstances .
** WARNING - CONTAINS SPOILERS ! ** First of all , I would like to say that I really liked this game . I got it for Christmas after two months of dropping hints to my parents . I am glad that I did that . First off , I would like to say that the single player was very good . The first level is probably one of the best in the game , when you are at a party in London , and some evil guys ruin it by kidnapping the Prime minister 's daughter . Of course you have to rescue her , and it is quite a big level , but should probably take you at least five minutes . The best part , and I think also the funniest part , is when you are in the jet-pack , and people are rappelling down Big Ben . Just equip the jet-pack 's most trusty rocket launcher and blast the clock faces and the enemies down . Pure fun ! The rest of the levels are very good , but pretty short . There are four mini-levels you can unlock , and that is one of the let downs , because only the first two of them are actually fun , and the last two to unlock are just 'kill 25 enemies ' objectives , I mean , c'mon ! We got loads of points to unlock these missions and the last two bonus missions are really bad ! The multi player , me and some of my friends agree , is very good and challenging , even if there are no bots . Halo did n't have any bots but that is still some fine multi player games ! You can be a load of bad guys , and you go against each other , and you can also set traps , which is the best way of killing people without going into view of their character . Gameplay - 8.5/10 ( levels can be quite repetitive and bonus missions could be improved ) . Graphics - 9/10 ( there is the odd bad graphic , but that is n't extremely often ) . Multiplayer - 10/10 ( needs no comment , just great , you get to drive in jet-packs and vehicles ) . Sound - 8/10 Replay value - 7/10 ( the only levels I go back on are the Loondon level and Istanbul Part 1 ) . I give this game : 8.5/10 Could have a bit of improvement , but it 's still good .
FLAVIA THE HERETIC is a strange entry in the nunsploit genre - equal parts sleaze , feministic journey , and `` history '' as we follow Flavia on her strange trip . We start off with Flavia in a convent ... she ai n't too happy there cuz she does n't believe in all the male-dominated `` rules '' and macho-ism of the world around her and escapes from the convent with her Jewish pal , Abraham . They are both eventually caught and Flavia is brought back to the convent where she joins another `` non-believing '' nun in hastening a Moslem invasion . Flavia hangs out with the Moslems who take over the convent and get `` busy '' with the nuns in a strange set of scenes . Eventually the Moslems roll-out and Flavia is punished as a traitor to Christianity in another singularly brutal scene ... This one has pretty much all the stuff that I like to see in a 70 's era exploit film - some good gore , including nipple-removal , and a nice leg-skinning scene , some decent nudity - including the requisite full-frontal , and a decent storyline as well . I will say that it sorta dragged in a few points , but not enough to get truly bored with it . I would definitely recommend this one to nunsploit/70 's exploit fans ... 8/10
As a low budget enterprise in which the filmmakers themselves are manufacturing and distributing the DVDs themselves , we perhaps should n't expect too much from Broken in disc form . And yet what 's most remarkable about this whole achievement is the fact that this release comes with enough extras to shame a James Cameron DVD and a decidedly fine presentation . With regards to the latter , the only major flaw is that Broken comes with a non-anamorphic transfer . Otherwise we get the film in its original 1.85:1 ratio , demonstrating no technical flaws and looking pretty much as should be expected . Indeed , given Ferrari 's hands on approach in putting this disc together you can pretty much guarantee such a fact . The same is also true of the soundtrack . Here we are offered both DD2.0 and DD5.1 mixes and whilst I 'm uncertain as to which should be deemed the `` original '' , the fact that Ferrari had an involvement in both means neither should be considered as inferior . Indeed , though the DD5.1 may offer a more atmosphere viewing experience owing to the manner in which it utilizes the score , both are equally fine and free of technical flaws . As for extras the disc is positively overwhelmed by them . Take a look at the sidebar on the right of the screen and you 'll notice numerous commentaries , loads of featurettes and various galleries . Indeed , given the manner in which everything has been broken down into minute chunks rather than compiled into a lengthy documentary , there really is little to discuss . The 'Anatomy of a Stunt ' featurette , for example , is exactly what it claims to be , and the same goes for the rest of pieces . As such we get coverage on pretty much ever aspect of Broken 's pre-production , production and post-production . And whilst it may have been preferable to find them in a more easily digestible overall 'making of ' , in this manner we do get easy access to whatever special feature we may wish to view . Of the various pieces , then , it is perhaps only the commentaries which need any kind of discussion . Then again , there 's also a predictable air to each of the chat tracks . The one involving the actors is overly jokey and does n't take the film too seriously . Ferrari 's pieces are incredibly enthusiastic about the whole thing . And the technical ones are , well , extremely technical . Of course , we also get some crossover with what 's been covered elsewhere on the discs , but at only 19 minutes none of these pieces outstay their welcome . Indeed , all in all , a fine extras package .
This movie is outrageous , funny , ribald , sophisticated & hits the bullseye where 99 % of Hollywood movies do n't even make the target . Paul Bartel should be recognized as one of the great directors of this or any era . He 's the American Renoir & Bunuel _ combined ! ! ! Glad I have the videodisc .
Such a delightful movie ! Very heart warming . One ca n't help falling in love with the character of Gigi . He 's adorable as a child and grows into a sensitive artist . The whole movie revolves around him . He lives in a wonderful world  living all life  curiosity , desire and anticipation . There is an elder brother who tries to steal his glory but really remains in the shadow all his life . The father is very stereotypically Italian and so is the mother . I wanted the father to come and reunite with the mother in the last scene  and have them cry and laugh . I also wish that there was at least something redeeming about the elder brother . His personality seems to have been trashed entirely . Passion and ardour  that 's the key to life . And looking through the camera  focusing on small details and savoring the delicate details of life .
I question anyone saying they do n't care for this movie . Some reviewers have said it did n't have enough action , some said it was too long , etc . Do n't listen to them ! ! ! If you like Shawshank Redemption and/or Braveheart , you will definitely love this movie ! The acting performances are superb ! Tim Roth , John Hurt and Jessica Lang are allsuperb and Liam Neeson does an admarible job and is a very imposing character because of his size . The Cinemaphotography was brilliant and breathtaking . It is onw of the few movies I have seen in my life ( along with Shawshank ) that was virtually flawless from casting , directing , writing , acting , etc. ! ! ! I was amazed this was n't in the top 50 or 100 movies reviewed . I felt so passionately about it that I just registered with IMDB so I could let everyone know the real scoop . I have seen this movie about 10 times ( each time with a different person ) and everyone has loved it ! You must be awake and pay attention carefully for the first 30 minutes because they introduce quite a few characters in the beginning . If you have the attention span longer than most of these juvenille kids writing reviews for the movies on this site , than you will love this movie ! Come on ... all 3 Lord of the Rings movies in the top 9 and the Matrix at # 32 ? ! ? ! That should show you the age range of most reviewers here ! This is a top 50 movie ! ! !
'Una Giornata Particolare ' is a movie that has a title that sounds so familiar I thought I had seen it more than once . Now that I finally I have seen it , I am very glad . This is one of the better Italian movies I know , with one of the most wonderful performances by Marcello Mastroianni , who stars in other masterpieces such as 'La Dolce Vita ' and '8 1/2 ' , both from the great Federico Fellini . Directed by Ettore Scola , this is a movie that takes the time to introduce the characters and slowly develops a story on a special day , the day Adolf Hitler visited Rome . Marcello Mastroianni plays Gabriele , the neighbor of Antonietta ( Sophia Loren ) . She is a member of Mussolini 's party , pretty fanatic in her thoughts , and he is a member no more . The reason for that I will not reveal . On the day every person from their building , including her husband and children , is out to see Hitler , they are still in the building . Antonietta 's bird escapes and flies to Gabriele 's apartment , and this is how the two meet . Right before Antonietta went to Gabriele he thought of killing himself , again for reasons I will not reveal . How the story develops from here I will not reveal , but it is what happens between the two that makes this such a special day , not the fact that Hitler is in Rome . Like I said , Mastroianni has a wonderful performance . You see he is a man who desperately wants someone around him , although at first we do n't know why . May be he likes Antonietta , may be he is in love with her , may be there are other reasons . Antonietta feels what we feel . What does this man want from her ? She likes the attention anyway . We see how she does her hair to look attractive for the man . Loren plays the scenes very good as well . We understand her questions , although we ca n't be sure what her intentions are . The moments where we find out both their secrets , if that is what you can call it , is a great moment . How the story develops from there is even more interesting , but I do n't want to spoil it for you . This is a movie you should see . Great performances and a beautiful cinematography , and the message it gives us still stands today .
I 've just finished viewing the 1st disc in a 4-disc ( 26 episodes ) collection created in conjunction with the UCLA Film & Television Archive ( S'More Entertainment , Inc. ) . So far ( aside from the 1st episode ) , the image quality is quite good . The DVD box is shown on the title page here on IMDb . `` Mr. Peepers '' is just as charming as when I first saw it ( 5-years old at the time ) and Wally Cox is truly endearing in this role . If you 're in the mood for quiet comedy that sneaks up on you , as opposed to hitting you over the head , you 'll treasure this chance to experience all the wonderful characters you might remember from your childhood . Although some of the gags are a bit corny , most are ingenious and well-executed ... and even the corny ones are fun . This is one TV series that lives up to my early childhood memories of it .
Like TALK RADIO , THE BOOTH is actually kinda predictable ( TALK RADIO because we know the truth of what happened going in , THE BOOTH because of- let 's face it- the genre and the basic set-up ) . That 's not necessarily a bad thing , in this case . It means , in essence , that the filmmakers do n't punk out in the end the way they might 've in , say , an American version of this story . THE BOOTH moves inexorably toward its ( foregone ) conclusion , but is so beautifully crafted on every level that one can enjoy the ride the way one might a familiar cruise along a well-travelled stretch of ( very scenic ) road . It reminds me of Harlan Ellison 's spooky short story , FLOP SWEAT . The claustrophobia is , at times , almost palpable . Worth a nice long look .
This was obviously the prototype for Mick Dundee but 'The Adventures of Barry McKenzie is funnier . I was amused throughout and laughed out loud plenty of times . Terrific central performance by Barry Crocker in the title role , an Australian who invades England to upset the poms with his free-flowing uncouth ways . Few Brits will be upset by Barry 's frequently cruel observations on his hosts . The relationsip between the two countries is prickly but friendly and this is highlighted by the film 's final line , delivered by a somewhat reluctant McKenzie as he boards the plane home . `` I was just starting to like the poms . ''
Faithful adaptation of witty and interesting French novel about a cynical and depressed middle-aged software engineer ( or something ) , relying heavily on first-person narration but none the worse for that . Downbeat ( in a petit-bourgeois sort of way ) , philosophical and blackly humorous , the best way I could describe both the film and the novel is that it is something like a more intellectual Charles Bukowski ( no disrespect to CB intended ) . Mordantly funny , but also a bleak analysis of social and sexual relations , the film 's great achievement is that it reflects real life in such a recognisable way as to make you ask : why are n't other films like this ? One of the rare examples of a good book making an equally good film .
Before the regular comments , my main curiosity about THIS IS NOT A LOVE SONG is that while there 's a running time listed on IMDb of 94 minutes , the DVD from Wellspring Media in the United States runs 88 minutes . Any input on this is appreciated ! Two friends with very rough lives take on the road for an adventure . What they wind up in is just that , with one accidentally shooting a girl and the two escaping by foot into the countryside . Rather than just a big chase , the film is complicated by the the daft and rather childlike Spike behaving inappropriately , and clutching his boom box like a teddy bear . Some viewers may dislike the story based solely upon the character Spike , but without a bit of frustration added to the story , the film would have been too easy . You 'll notice the way the more stable character Heaton refers to Spike as `` big man '' in contrast to Spike 's `` kid out of control '' attitude and behavior . Frankly , I too was aggravated by Spike 's ridiculous actions , especially the spray can sniffing , but in a desperate situation it 's apparent someone of his mentality would choose an temporary escape . But , Heaton was there to keep things in check up until things get way over his head as well . Kenny Glenaan as Heaton is a marvel , and after a while I quit wondering why in the heck he would want to pick Spike up from prison and continue a friendship , due to Glenaan 's great performance . After all , there are many many reasons during their run that would be a good idea for Heaton to just ditch Spike and try to save himself . I suppose Heaton felt like a protective older brother to Spike , and the loyalty between the two is hard to break -- until things get too desperate . While some of the cinematography is indeed artsy , it does offer more flavor to story instead of just shots of the men running through the wilderness . The beautiful landscapes , rain , and vast gray skies offer a somber tone that increases the feel of the tragic circumstances . The score is unusual as well , and the use of Public Image Ltd. 's song `` This Is Not A Love Song '' and as the title of the film is quite smart . Overall , it 's understandable if you do n't care for THIS IS NOT A LOVE SONG as it 's focused on two contrasting personalities escaping from another man determined to hunt them down ( played by a cool , quiet David Bradley ) . It 's not big-budget action entertainment . For the rest of us that enjoy seeking out something minimal and dramatic , it 's time worthwhile spent , and it DOES offer some extremely tense moments that have you holding your breath a bit . I 'm really enjoying the films coming out of Scotland recently , with the likes of this one , Dog Soldiers , and The Devil 's Tattoo . I 'm also a bit thankful for the subtitles offered on this DVD , as the accents are sometimes lightning fast and difficult for some viewers like me to understand . Frustrating , dark , and often tense , THIS IS NOT A LOVE SONG is very tragic yet engrossing storytelling .
Robert Siodmak does a fabulous job with this B noir starring Ella Raines , Franchot Tone , and Alan Curtis . And he does it , I might add , without a lot of help from his male actors , i.e. , Curtis and Tone . It 's Raines all the way , a pretty , leggy actress who for one reason or another never reached the status of some of her `` noir '' counterparts . Siodmak 's use of sex , light , shadows , and music is truly remarkable as he tackles this genre . The shadows , lighting effects , and camera angles are all effective . But the highlight of the film takes place in a nightclub with a very sexual drum riff by Elisha Cook , egged on by an excited Raines . It 's this scene that brings `` Phantom Lady '' into new territory . Siodmak 's commitment to the material is matched only by Raines , who gives a sincere performance as a woman in love trying to save her man . Franchot Tone phoned this one in . Alan Curtis did n't seem upset that he might die and did n't seem happy that he lived . And he never , except for a brief moment in prison , seemed to be in love with Raines . The amusing thing about many of these films is that , as World War II progressed , interest in psychiatry deepened . But often the terms were used incorrectly in films such as `` Possessed , '' `` Spellbound , '' and `` The Greatest Show on Earth . '' Tone is called paranoid by Thomas Gomez - Tone probably has some paranoia attached to his disorder , but he appears to be closer to a psychopath . In actuality , as evidenced by his headaches , he may have had a brain tumor pushing against his brain . Phantom Lady does n't have the greatest plot , but it 's well worth watching .
It helps immensely if one is familiar with the culture and time period in which this film takes place . First of all , these ladies are NOT geisha , they are oiran ( prostitutes ) in the Yoshiwara-type `` green houses '' , circa 1860 , give or take.. This should help clear up some details which may be confusing to the unaware . The film deals with issues of loyalty , love and , perhaps most importantly , how people deal with adversity , both their own and that of others in their immediate environment . That plus the outrageous photography together with the hauntingly beautiful music , make for a lovely ride . Just plug it in , suspend your disbelief and enter their world . You wo n't be disappointed .
I am a huge fan of Vonnegut 's work and I 'm very fond of this movie , but I would n't say that this is a film of the `` Mother Night '' that I read . When people say that Vonnegut is unfilmable , two things come to my mind . One is that many of his themes are very near the knuckle or even taboo , despite the accusation sometimes used against him that he chooses relatively `` easy '' targets for his satire . This means less every day that passes as far as filmability is concerned . Directors these days appear to revel in breaking taboos and I have high hopes for the version of `` Bluebeard '' now in production . Amazing to think that an innocent piece like Vonnegut 's `` Sirens of Titan '' would probably have been the equivalent of `` R '' rated if filmed when it was published back in the 50s , for its violence , language and sexual and thematic content , though it 's a tragedy that nobody 's come up yet with a filmable script for it . And in the present economic climate , I also hope some director out there is looking closely at `` Jailbird '' , `` Galapagos '' and `` Hocus Pocus '' . The other thing is his narrative style , heaping irony upon irony upon irony but still making it hilariously funny . It seems impossible to objectify , and that appears to be the biggest obstacle to making great films of his great novels , because the little authorial comments that colour our response as readers are just not possible in movies without resorting to too often clumsy techniques like `` talkovers '' . Vonnegut suggested that there was a character missing from filmed versions of his work , himself as author/narrator . To its credit , `` Breakfast of Champions '' ( the movie ) tried to keep the comedy and came a bit of a cropper for its pains . As did another turkey made from a Vonnegut novel , `` Slapstick '' in an even more spectacular way . Still , there 's nothing wrong with a director giving us his subjective interpretation of Vonnegut , and `` Mother Night '' is an excellent example of how , as another reviewer put it , a good director can add a visual poetry to a source like this . But so much of the humour is lost that though it 's the same plot , it 's not really from the same novel I read . If it had been , I 'd probably have been rolling in the aisles laughing a few times watching it . For a reader of the novel , I think a chuckle even at the end is forgivable . The end of the film , however , is truly poignant , and I think one of the film 's successes is that it can genuinely leave you feeling that you 've watched someone walk a razor 's edge between good and evil , and the jury is still out . Standing alone and of itself it 's well worth a look . Technically there are some minor but glaring errors , notably in continuity , and it too often looks drab and theatrical , but most of the time it hits an acceptable note and occasionally shows considerable imagination and resourcefulness . The acting in general is of a high order , even if maybe the dialogue is by today 's standards a little stilted . It survives quite well watching back to back with `` Slaughterhouse-5 '' , and there is actually quite a bit more `` good '' filmed Vonnegut out there , mostly versions of his short stories - `` Harrison Bergeron '' , `` Who Am I This Time ? '' and some other things like , of course , the misfiring filmed version of his very funny but disposable play , `` Happy Birthday Wanda June '' . Also there was an interesting piece , if it still exists , done in the 70s called `` Between Time And Timbuktu '' which Vonnegut apparently did n't like much , although he was involved in its production , because he felt it misinterpreted him in its generality . He said it reminded him of the bizarre surgical experiments performed in the HG Wells tale `` The Island of Dr. Moreau '' , but it did for many people serve as an excellent introduction to his work . But if the films do n't make you want to go to the superior source material , they 're not doing their job . As the man said , more or less , the big show is inside your head .
THE ODD COUPLE is the classic film version of Neil Simon 's most famous play about a TV newswriter named Felix Unger , who is an obsessive neat freak , who moves in with his divorced best friend , Oscar Madison , a sportswriter and complete slob , after his wife Frances throws him out of their apartment . Already divorced , Oscar takes his best friend in and regrets it from the moment he does it . Neil Simon 's classic comedy first came to Broadway with Art Carney playing Felix and Walter Matthau playing Oscar . Jack Lemmon takes over for Carney in the film version with a memorable performance as Felix Unger . Lemmon is not only terribly funny in the role but so vividly real that he brings an element of melancholy to the pitiful figure that is Felix Unger . Matthau , fortunately , was allowed to recreate his role as Oscar , a one-of-a-kind gem of comic performance that provides consistent laughs throughout . This teaming of Lemmon and Matthau turned out to be comic gold that was re-visited in nine other films . With both of these actors no longer with us , the viewing of this classic becomes more touching but no less hilarious . Simon 's play has been nicely expanded for the screen with a silent prologue chronicling a depressed Felix 's suicide attempt that is a winner . The supporting cast includes Herb Edelman , John Fiedler , Larry Haines , and David Sheiner as Oscar 's poker playing buddies and Moncia Evans and Carole Shelley as the Piedgon Sisters , blind dates of Oscar and Felix . Of course , it later became an excellent TV series with Tony Randall and Jack Klugman , but there 's nothing like the original . A joy from start to finish .
Being the prototype of the classical Errol Flynn adventure movie and having a good story as well as two more brilliant co-stars in Maureen O'Hara ( what an exquisite beauty ! ) and Anthony Quinn , I can only recommend this movie to all those having even the slightest liking for romance and adventure . Hollywood at its best !
Eric Clapton , Jack Bruce and Ginger Baker re-unite to play all their songs from 35 years ago when they formed a trio called `` Cream . '' Those were the psychedelic days of England and America and these guys looked it : all skinny , very long hair , wild clothes and loud music . They played a combination of rock and blues and it was , for the most part , good stuff . Well , these guys are now 60-something years old and they can still sing and play at a high level as this wonderful DVD concert disc shows us . I was always extremely familiar with Clapton , of course , who has never been out of the limelight , but I did n't know what to expect from Bruce and Baker , neither of whom I had n't seen in decades . They surprised me . When he was young , Baker was so gaunt he looked like a speed freak near death . Now he looks healthy , in shape and his drum playing was solid . Bruce looked a bit haggard but his voice is great , as good as ever and a pleasure to hear on these old songs . This is just excellent material and performing from guys who know what they 're doing . Some people criticized this show for being low-key . I do n't agree with that . I have no complaints . The concert sounded very good . The second song , `` Spoonful , '' was outstanding , the highlight of the concert for me . Highly recommended .
This film could well have been one of those ordinary `` soapies '' relating the day to day events of half a dozen families whose lives are intertwined ..broken relationships , building new friendships , street bashings , near accidents , hopes and dreams and even the discovery of a baby discarded under some bushes ! What a mixture of events ! Fortunately the film maker goes beyond those daily events and poses questions to consider although there are no satisfactory answers . He asks in this chaotic world do things just happen , is it just luck when things turn out right or , taking a fatalistic view , is a person predestined to be at a certain place at a certain time and thus become involved in the event and his future takes on a new perspective ? Most of us have had this uncanny experience . Is it our super ego that makes us believe we are so important ? As one character says he once sat on the edge overlooking the Grand Canyon and came to realize how infinitely small he was . This is not one of my favourite films but is a good study of human relationships . Danny Glover is outstanding in a sympathetic role .
The pilot of Enterprise has one thing that has been lacking since the original Star Trek : A dose of realistic , flawed personalities . The Utopian characters of the Next Generation got tiring , they were so noble as to be unbelievable . I also like the sub-plot that humans are bitter toward the Vulcans . Its funny seeing them as pretentious snobs . It makes me look forward to seeing when the humans become the dominant race between the two , though I do n't think it would work in the time frame of the show . The only negatives that jumped out at me were the `` quick cut off the ending at 2 hours '' feel of the end , which is common among many of the Trek shows . The second was the shameless dig for ratings by a couple of senselessly sexy scenes . It was out of place , a good science fiction show should be able to stand on its own without trying to pad the pre-teen audience with some skin . But its not my job to make the show profitable , so oh well . Lets see how the next episode does .
`` Some day , we 'll walk in the rays of a beautiful sun . Some day , when the world is much brighter '' - The 5 Stairsteps `` O-o-h Child '' Movies about Black teenagers usually involve inner city gangs dealing drugs or committing violence to a hip-hop soundtrack . Films about the everyday problems of ordinary inner city teens are hard to find , yet there is an undiscovered gem that I would like to recommend . Our Song , by Jim McKay is about three girls in the Crown Heights section of Brooklyn who learn that their high school will be closed for asbestos removal and must decide on their future direction , one that may involve going their separate ways . The story is told from the point of view of a 15-year old , not from an adult reminiscing about the past as in most coming of age movies . Avoiding the mandatory street slang and excessive use of F-words , it delivers an honest and loving portrait of three friends at a crossroads in their life . The girls : Lanisha ( Kerry Washington ) , Joycelyn ( Anna Simpson ) , and Maria ( Melissa Martinez ) are in their sophomore year at the local high school . They are active members of the Jackie Robinson Steppers , a real-life marching band whose rehearsals for a Labor Day parade provide discipline and purpose to their lives . Similar to David Gordon Green 's George Washington but less stylized , the film showcases non-professional black and Latino actors with Kerry Washington as the standout . While the performances have some amateurish moments , I became so involved with the story that I forgot the girls were even acting . Maria , whose father is in jail , has learned that she is pregnant by Terrell , a local student . She wants to have the baby in spite of the fact that she is only 15 and knows that Terrell is probably not going to be of much help . Joycelyn works in an up-scale dress shop but dreams about becoming a singer . In a very poignant scene in her bedroom , she pretends to be talking to her fans , then lies down in bed to recite one of her poems . She is close to Lanisha and Maria at the beginning but drifts off to make friends outside of the neighborhood . None of the girls receive much support at home and Maria is too afraid to even tell her mother about her baby . Yet , the single moms are not typical movie deadbeats or alcoholics . They are warm and loving parents whose time with their children is limited because of the pressure of supporting the family . Lanisha 's parents are divorced but she is able to visit her father , a doorman in a luxury apartment building and talk about music . Her mother is comforting when Lanisha learns that a friend in the neighborhood has committed suicide , a somewhat melodramatic plot point in an otherwise realistic film . As the summer winds down , the girls drift apart and each decides on a different course . There are no big dramatic moments , however , only the sad recognition of the inevitability of change . Though we do not have blinders on about the frustrations that may await them , we identify with their hopes and dreams without dwelling on the negative . Our Song is an emotionally satisfying film about growing up in the projects that refuses to see life in any terms other than possibility .
Carter Wong plays a noble hero on a quest for a book of healing which leads him seeking ultimate vengeance ! The pacing is good in this film and there are a lot of fight scenes to keep the movie going . The flying guillotines look wicked and the main villain has no problems using them . Although the story is n't strong , the action is fun and draws you to the very end ( which I felt could 've had a sequel ) . Campy and dark , this is great ol skool kung fu ! !
EL MAR is a tough , stark , utterly brilliant , brave work of cinematic art . Director Agustí Villaronga , with an adaptation by Antoni Aloy and Biel Mesquida of Blai Bonet 's novel , has created a film that traces the profound effects of war on the minds of children and how that exposure wrecks havoc on adult lives . And though the focus is on war 's heinous tattoo on children , the transference to like effects on soldiers and citizens of adult age is clear . This film becomes one of the finest anti-war documents without resorting to pamphleteering : the end result has far greater impact because of its inherent story following children 's march toward adulthood . A small group of children are shown in the Spanish Civil War of Spain , threatened with blackouts and invasive nighttime slaughtering of citizens . Ramala ( Nilo Mur ) , Tur ( David Lozano ) , Julia ( Sergi Moreno ) , and Francisca ( Victoria Verger ) witness the terror of the assassination of men , and the revenge that drives one of them to murder and suicide . These wide-eyed children become adults , carrying all of the psychic disease and trauma repressed in their minds . We then encounter the three who survive into adulthood where they are all confined to a tuberculosis sanitarium . Ramala ( Roger Casamajor ) has survived as a male prostitute , protected by his 'john ' Morell ( Juli Mira ) , and has kept his life style private . Tur ( Bruno Bergonzini ) has become a frail sexually repressed gay male whose cover is his commitment to Catholicism and the blur of delusional self-mutilation/crucifixion . Francisca ( Antònia Torrens ) has become a nun and serves the patients in the sanitarium . The three are re-joined by their environment in the sanitarium and slowly each reveals the scars of their childhood experiences with war . Tur longs for Ramala 's love , Ramala longs to be free from his Morell , and Francisca must face her own internal needs covered by her white nun 's habit . The setting of the sanitarium provides a graphic plane where the thin thread between life and death , between lust and love , and between devotion and destruction is played out . To detail more would destroy the impact of the film on the individual viewer , but suffice it to say that graphic sex and full nudity are involved ( in some of the most stunningly raw footage yet captured on film ) and the viewer should be prepared to witness every form of brutality imaginable . For this viewer these scenes are of utmost importance and Director Villaronga is to be applauded for his perseverance and bravery in making this story so intense . The actors , both as children and as adults , are splendid : Roger Cassamoor , Bruno Bergonzini and Antònia Torrens are especially fine in inordinately difficult roles . The cinematography by Jaime Peracaula and the haunting musical score by Javier Navarrete serve the director 's vision . A tough film , this , but one highly recommended to those who are unafraid to face the horrors of war and its aftermath . In Spanish with English subtitles . Grady Harp
I loved so much about this movie ... the time taken to develop the characters , the attention to detail , the superb performances , the stunning lighting and cinematography , the wonderful soundtrack ... It has a combined intensity and lightness of touch that wo n't work for anyone who wants the typical fast-paced action flick . If we lived in Elizabethan days , I 'd say this movie 's a bit like a Shakespearean tragedy . But since we do n't , let 's say it 's more like a Drama-Suspense movie . The plot is simple , but the story is complex . The movie is intelligent in the way relationships and issues are explored . Much of the story is shown rather than told , which I find makes it more subtle and moving - and which also works well for a story based on a comic book ( or graphic novel ) . At times I felt I was actually there in the 1930s , part of this story - there was such a realistic yet dream-like quality in the style of its telling . I do n't often prefer movies to the books they were based upon , but in this case I do . ( Though I did enjoy the book too . ) I 've bought the DVD , which is great because it has some wonderful deleted scenes and insightful commentary . ( I also took my little cousin , who 's a little younger than the boy in the movie , to see it after I saw it for the first time , because he has issues at home and I wanted to use this as a way of starting a discussion on father-son issues with him . He loved it - and the discussion . )
Just read the original story which is written by Pu in 18th century . Strikingly , the movie despict the original spirit very well , though the plot was modified tremendously . The film language , the rhythm , the special effect are all from hollywood , but still there is a chinese core . It is amazing how Hark Tsui managed to combine them together . The result is pure beauty .
It takes a very special kind of person to make a movie that is so wretched , beguiling , disgusting and repulsive , but make it in a way that also makes it brilliant and the quintessence of personal cinematic liberation . Crispin Glover , in all of his `` out there '' antics and predispositions , truly made something that is unique . In a world that has become starkly partisan , this film seems to evade the standard lines of creativity and art and effectively startle everyone . Right off the bat , the film takes on a rather distant paradigm ( if there really is a model at all ) and initially shapes it with the likes of Shirley Temple in front of a swastika and naked women pleasuring a man with cerebral palsy . It 's rather shocking stuff , but if you had the opportunity for the Q & A sessions after the screenings , it clearly opens up a bag of worms that leaves you wondering whether this is art or just the lowest common denominator . In either guise , you sense the tremor that this film will ultimately cause . It will never be accepted , not even by the supposed auteurs of the world who boringly speak about the human condition . You may not like it , but it is certainly something worth watching .
Director Douglas Sirk scores again with this , the grandaddy of all dysfunctional family films . This lush , trashy saga is a masterpiece , beautifully combining all of the elements of Sirk 's soapers and strategically placing them all into one movie . `` Written on the Wind '' very obviously influenced the 1980s TV series `` Dallas '' and `` Dynasty '' , as this is basically a feature-length version of those later nighttime soaps . Lauren Bacall , wonderfully and subtly , plays Lucy Moore , a New York City secretary who marries oil baron , Kyle Hadley ( Robert Stack ) . Unbeknownst to both of them , Mitch Wayne ( Rock Hudson ) is also in love with the quiet , but sexy secretary . They all go back to Kyle 's family 's mansion in Texas where we meet his white trash slut-of-a-sister , Marylee ( Dorothy Malone in an Oscar-winning turn ) . Yipee ! The sparks begin to fly - from the romances to the catfights , this is a campy trip . Not only does Mitch have to fight the feelings he has for his best friend 's wife , but Marylee tries to sleep with everybody since she ca n't have her one true love who is Mitch . Topping it all off , Kyle learns he 's impotent , but somehow Lucy ends up pregnant . This is pure soap and pure melodramatic entertainment . How can you not love it ? This film signals one of Universal 's most popular films and one of director Sirk 's best works . Some of the dialogue is absolutely sizzling and visual metaphors are thrown in every which way - the theme of wind throughout is great . The cast is great , although Bacall is completely underused despite receiving top-billing behind Hudson . Stack 's Oscar loss reportedly devastated him . He considered this his finest performance and apparently was none too pleased to lose out . And he did turn out a fabulous performance as the whimpering alcoholic . What a stunning movie ! This film proves what I 've been thinking for ages - Sirk is the master of classic melodrama . Where 's his Oscar ?
I am a massive fan of Jet Li ! He is THE best HK action film star alive ... and consequently - This film rocked ! I saw it in the video store and , as it was in the mainstream section of this mainstream video store , I didnt register its presence at first , and had to look twice . I immediately knew what I would be renting out . My only qualm ( I suppose I expected it ) is that it was dubbed ( AAARGh ) and not subtitled . Elsewise , the movie 's original/strange/cool plot , and full on action made it one of Jet Li 's better movies ... even though they all fall under that category ... .
Louis Sachar 's compelling children 's classic is about as Disney as Freddy Krueger . It 's got murder , racism , facial disfigurement and killer lizards . Tightly plotted , it 's a multi-layered , interlinking story that spans history to reveal Stanley 's own heritage and the secret behind the holes . It races from Latvia 's lush greenness to the pock-marked Camp Green Lake ( hint : there 's no lake and no green ) . Disney 's first success is re-creating the novel 's environments so convincingly - the set design is superb and without gloss . The other plus is in the casting . Rising star Shia LaBeouf ( Charlie 's Angels 2 , Project Greenlight ) might not be the fat boy of the book , but his attitude is right and he 's far from the usual clean-cut hero . The rest of the cast is filled out equally well , from Patricia Arquette as the Frontier school marm-turned-bank robber to Henry Winkler as Stanley 's dad . The downside is the pop soundtrack - pure marketing department - and having the sentiment turned up to full volume at the end .
I had never heard of this film before a couple of weeks ago , but its concept interested me when I heard it : an American man meets a European woman on his last night in Europe and they spend the night together talking . It sparked my interest , but I never expected it to be this great . Before Sunrise is a masterpiece , and it 's also one of the most romantic films on record . To my surprise , it completely lacked the cynicism of the 1990s . It 's impossible to really talk too much about it , since there is no real plot , so to speak ( although there are plenty of thoroughly interesting things you could talk about ; it is sort of like My Dinner With Andre , where there is a conversation , but it 's not JUST the conversation that matters ) , but let me just say , see it . SEE IT !
This was playing at our theater in Amsterdam and the film we wanted to see was sold-out so we went to this , not knowing anything about it other than it was a documentary about the planet . We were very happy at our misfortune as this was a very powerful film about life and the delicate balance we all share with the rest of the inhabitants of Earth . This film has some of the most breathtaking photography I have ever seen in a film and took me places from deserts to oceans to rain forests and displayed things I have never seen in a film , TV or book ! `` Earth '' is a film that every student should see before they become jaded . I will encourage my niece to see this film since she will be inheriting the planet we leave her . This is also a film to see on a theater screen or a very big television since the photography is so powerful and exotic .
The premise for this movie is simple and so is the script : an elderly Muslim gets his teenage son to drive him in his similarly elderly station wagon from France to the haj in Mecca , Saudi Arabia , so that he can fulfill his holy Muslim obligation before he dies . The father is clearly devoutly religious , but the son is unimpressed ; he accepts out of obligation to his father rather than to religion , he 'd rather be with his ( non-Muslim ) girlfriend . The father is stubborn in a lot of things which the son does n't understand and the petulance between them is the device that maintains the drama , although it is often rather irksome . However , like any good road movie there are oddball characters encountered along the way ; for example a woman on a backroad in Croatia who upon being asked for directions to Belgrade simply gets in the backseat and points with her hand uttering one word which they assume to be a place but ca n't find it on the map . In Bulgaria another man they ask directions of confirms he can speak French but then provides an extensive commentary in Bulgarian . There is also occasional humor - in one country the son tires of eating egg sandwiches and wants meat - they are given a goat , but unfortunately ( perhaps fortunately for the viewer ) it runs away before the father can perform the Muslim slaughterman ritual . They eventually make it to Mecca - the Muslim equivalent of the Vatican but on a much grander scale . For westerners it is all bizarre but fascinating . The movie is n't sophisticated but is charming in its own way , a kind of National Geographic with soul .
This is a really strange film -- and that is NOT a bad thing . It is a combination of a neo-realistic film about the homeless AND a fairy tale . I 'm sure that some may find this movie a bit too strange , but I loved it . Once again , this director brings together a wonderful cast of everyday people ( not actors ) and gets a great ensemble-type performance . Although not nearly as sad as Umberto D , both movies have a very similar point to make -- this one just does it in a very absurdist way . Ignore the cheesy special effects -- after all , it was made in the early 1950s and special effects are n't terribly important anyway ( or at least they should n't be in films ) . Instead , just sit back and enjoy the very strange and silly ride . Unless you are a total curmudgeon , you 'll have a ball . By the way , since I first reviewed this film , I have seen another DeSica directed film that is an absolute must-see and that is THE CHILDREN ARE WATCHING US . While not a fantasy or light in spirit like MIRACLE IN MILAN , a great film nevertheless .
There 's some very clever humour in this film , which is both a parody of and a tribute to actors . However , after a while it just seems an exercise in style ( notwithstanding great gags such as Balasko continuing the part of Dussolier , and very good acting by all involved ) and I was wondering why Blier made this film . All is revealed in the ending , when Blier , directing Claude Brasseur , gets a phone call from his dad ( Bernard Blier ) - from heaven , and gets the chance to say how much he misses him . An effective emotional capper and obviously heartfelt . But there is n't really sufficient dramatic tension or emotional involvement to keep the rest of the film interesting throughout it 's entire running time . Some really nice scenes and sequences , however , and anyone who likes these 'mosntres sacrés ' of the French cinema should get a fair amount of enjoyment out of this film .
In 1942 a film TALES OF MANHATTAN told a set of stories that were basically unrelated , but tied together with a suit of men 's evening wear . Each story began when the `` tails '' were passed from one owner ( Charles Boyer , for instance ) to another ( Ceasar Romero ) . WINCHESTER '73 , a superior film , and a great western , has a similar plot twist . Initially it is about how Jimmy Stewart is seeking Stephen ( Horace ) MacMahon for some deadly grudge . But in the course of the film the two men get into a shooting contest , the prize ( given by Marshall Wyatt Earp - Will Geer ) being one of the new Winchester rifles . Stewart barely beats out MacMahon , but the gun is stolen from Stewart , and the chase is on . The gun passes from hand to hand , including John McIntyre ( as an arrogant trader who fatally does not know when to stop being arrogant ) , to Rock Hudson ( in a surprising role - and a brief one at that ) , to Charles Drake , to Dan Duryea ( as the delightfully deadly and psychotic Waco Johnny Dean ) , to MacMahon . Eventually it does return to Stewart . The film is expertly directed by Anthony Mann . Every character has a wide variety of experiences . Duryea gets the rifle literally over Drake 's dead body ( Duryea forces the issue ) . But he loses it to MacMahon , who is faster on the draw - not that Duryea is stupid enough to fight for the rifle . As he and Shelley Winter look at MacMahon in the distance , Winter ( who watched Duryea kill her former boy friend Drake ) drops her distaste for the gunman momentarily to ask why he put up with MacMahon 's bullying for the gun . Philosophically , Duryea explains he can wait . Some opportunity will come up later on ( i.e. , when he can safely kill MacMahon and get back the rifle ) . The characters are remarkably human . Winters first appears as the future bride of Drake , but she sees a really big negative side to him - an unforgivable side . Drake is aware of this lapse , and it helps lead to his destruction . Other characters have realistic touches , such as J.C. Flippen as an army sergeant who fights an Indian attack with Steward and Steward 's friend Millard Mitchell . Oh yes , and with Flippen 's fellow soldier - Tony Curtis . Flippen makes one believe this soldier has been on a hundred battlefields before , since 1861 probably . Steward had showed emotions in other films . In IT 'S A WONDERFUL LIFE he showed a degree of anger at times , and also a near nervous breakdown when he thinks everything is wrong with his life . But here he showed a demonic anger - at the expense of a surprised Duryea ( who normally would show such anger himself ) . The parts of this film fit very neatly together , under Mann 's competent hands . This is one western that never wears out , as the audience watches the travels of a Winchester rifle .
Wonderful film , one of the best horror films of the 70s . She is realistic settings and atmospheres . As usual it was inevitable the usual negative comments . I have noticed that most horror films of a certain period many times fail to reach even sufficiency . Obviously because most horror movies are old and must be denigrati , is like a mental mechanism that moves the minds of the potential of music critics here . Before you read the review already knew what was the final judgment . In the film a good gift because 10 is really well done . Raines reads quite well and the film as a way in which it was produced reminds me a lot of Kubrick films . He really impression . Excellent film really . I consider a film anthology of years'70 .
Love it , love it , love it ! This is another absolutely superb performance from the Divine Miss M. From the beginning to the end , this is one big treat ! Do n't rent it- buy it now !
Of all the versions of the Odyssey ( or of any Greek mythological story for that matter ) , this in my opinion is the best of them all . Almost true to the original storyline - with some minor deviations and omissions , e.g . the absence of Scylla & Charybdis and the fact that Eumaeus the swineherd recognizes Odysseus in disguise in his hut - realistic acting and authentic scenery and costumes all contribute to make this a truly memorable masterpiece , not some Hollywoodish sword-and-sandal B-flick . Notwithstanding the fact that the dialogue and subtitles are completely in Italian , if one is familiar with the storyline , he can still make heads and tails of what is going on and what the actors are saying ( provided you have a good handy text of the Odyssey at hand ) . At least I did , and so much so that it has inspired me to study the Italian language to better appreciate the movie even more .
The narrative affirms the classic image of good versus evil in the form of a struggle of brother against brother . The main character , Lin Macadam , played by James Stewart , represents justice and righteousness . His brother , who operates under the persona of Dutch Henry Brown , played by Stephen McNally , stands for the classic stage-coach robbing western outlaw , chased by his brother for having killed their father . The world the story takes place is the classic dystopian west where the only way to prevent its inhabitants from killing each other is to take away their sidearms as soon as they enter town , and the man responsible for keeping this law and order is the classic western lawman Wyat Earp . Present as well are such flat characters typical of the western , such as the murderous Indian warrior , the besieged cavalryman , and the bonnet-clad damsel in distress . Another important archetype in this film , that which gives the film it 's name , is a custom made Winchester rifle . The weapon can be viewed as an allegory for the rewards given to those who do things honorably . Once it is stolen from its rightful owner , it brings tragedy to everyone that comes in contact with it . In this sense it resembles other such icons like the holy grail in Raiders of the Lost Ark , and the blood stained letter in Saving Private Ryan . This gives the film an element of surrealism which is usually absent from westerns , a genre not known for esoteric themes and symbols . Being essentially a revenge film , it shares this element with many other examples of the genre , such as Jack Arnold 's No Name on the Bullet , and Clint Eastwood 's Unforgiven . There is also a tacit theme of rape in Winchester '73 . Waco Johnny Dean , one of the film 's villains played very effectively by Dan Duryea , abducts a woman after killing her husband . The volatile cowboy toys with the tenderfoot husband , and dispatches him like a caricature of a cat toying with an insect before biting its head off . Waco Johnny Dean eventually gets what is coming to him after coming in contact with the ominous Winchester rifle . The main story of Winchester '73 is reminiscent of the mythological tale of Jason and his quest for the golden fleece , as told in Apollonius ' Argonautica . Both stories deal with the acquisition of a sacred object that possesses some sort of intangible quality . Like Jason , Stewart 's character hops from one adventure to the next in search of a one-of-a- kind prize . Another theme in Winchester '73 that is similar to a mythic tale is the struggle between brothers . Several stories of antiquity deal with this issue , such as the Hebrew Bible 's tale of Cain and Abel , and the vulgate tale of Romulus and Remus . As for the theme of abduction and rape present in Anthony Mann 's film , it is present in many mythological works , such as the rape of Europa as told by Ovid in his Metamorphoses . Winchester '73 is a fine example of the western genre , and acts as the objective correlative for many classic American western and ancient mythological themes .
I saw this little Belgian gem two days after seeing 'American Teen ' . Make no mistake about it , adolescence is a roller coaster ride , be it American or European . 'Naissance des Pieuvres ' ( or as it is being called in the U.S. 'Water Lillies ' ) is a tale of a young 15 year old girl ( played by Pauline Acquart , who at times resembles a young Scarlett Johansson ) acts the cool , withdrawn girl who wants to be on the school swim team , just to be close to another attractive girl ( Adele Haenel ) . It 's more than obvious that Marie is more than attracted to Floriane . Figuring among all of this is Marie 's rather plump , unattractive friend , Anne , who just wants a boyfriend like any other girl her age . Along the way , we are shown the usual array of teen pastimes ( broken hearts , shop lifting , alcohol and/or drug use , casual sex , etc. ) . This is a quiet little film that takes time to work it 's way into your system ( Michael Bay fans , take note : the pacing here is s-l-o-w , so steer clear ) , but if you have no problem with this , Water Lillies is a charmer . No rating here , but would pull down a hard `` R '' , due to language , nudity , adult situations .
Dream Quest was a surprisingly good movie . There were some noticeable goofs , but that can be expected in a movie like this that was made in such a short time . I did not feel any urge to fast forward during the movie and I found it pretty entertaining . It gets kind of silly at times , but overall I recommend it . They probably used up all the glitter in the nearby stores , and some of the costume designs were pretty good .
Many critics have felt offended that R.W . Fassbinder has portrayed both protagonist Wilkie and the Nazis in this movie in a human-like manner . Connoisseurs of other Fassbinder films , however , will realize that `` Lili Marleen '' ( 1981 ) belongs to Fassbinder 's `` women movies '' like `` The Marriage of Maria Braun '' ( 1979 ) and `` Lola '' ( 1981 ) . Fassbinder was convinced that `` stories can be told much better with women than with men '' , because , according to Fassbinder , while men usually fulfill their determined roles in society , `` women are capable of thinking in a dialectic manner '' . Dialectics , however , means that there is not only a thesis and its antithesis like usually in our black-and-white world , but a synthesis where the oppositions coincide . Moreover , dialectic means that because of the third instance of synthesis the absolute opposition of the difference between thesis and antithesis is abolished . Concretely speaking : Starting from a dialect point of view and portraying the fascist state , the underground fighters must necessarily use the basic means like the rulers do , and between offenders and victims there is thus a chiastic relation , so that every offender is also victim and every victim is also offender . Fassbinder has illustrated this abstract scheme , that transcends classical logic , in his play `` The City , the Garbage and the Death '' ( 1975 ) which was filmed by Daniel Schmid under the title `` Shadow of Angels '' ( 1976 ) . Therefore , approaching an a priori controversial topic like Nazi Germany , in a dialectic manner , the depiction of this time in the form of a movie gets even more controversial , especially for people who can not or do not want to see that our recognition of the world is by far not exhausted with a primitive light-switch schema , but needs the third instance of synthesis as controlling instance of its opposite members thesis and antithesis . The mutual relationship between offenders and victims has to scrutinized , since it is simply not true that the offenders are the bad ones and the victims the good ones . In a synthetic viewpoint , the bad ones participate on the goodness as the good ones participate on the badness . They are mutually related . In a world-view based on classical logic , a relation between good and bad can not even been established , and in an ethics based on this insufficient system of logic , the bad conscience of the survivors of Nazi Germany , feeling ( illogically enough ) responsible for the deeds of their ancestors , exclude the possibility of a relationship between the two extremes and thus a synthesis in the form a new evaluation based on this relationship as well . From Fassbinder 's dialectic viewpoint , it follows that neither Lili Marleen nor Lola nor Maria Braun can be condemned for their `` misuse '' of the ruling system for their private purposes , because they do n't misuse them , they just use them . In the opposite , since victims must repeat the actions of the offenders as the offenders must repeat the actions of the victims , because `` good '' and `` bad '' are no longer simple mirror images of one another like in two-valued logic , their strategies are legitimated by the chiastic structure of a logic that describes our world , that is not black and white at all , much better than a black-and-white logic .
This definitely is NOT the intellectual film with profound mission , so I really do n't think there is too much not to understand to in case you are n't Czech . It 's just a comedy . The humor is simple , pretty funny and sometimes , maybe , little morbid . Some actors and characters are very similar to Samotári ( 2000 ) ( Jirí Machácek , Ivan Trojan , Vladimír Dlouhý ) so the authors are . But it does n't matter , the genre is really different and these two films should n't be compared in this way . Jedna ruka netleská wo n't try to give you a lesson , it will try to make you laugh and there is some chance it will succeed . Not bad film , not the ingenious one , but I enjoyed it . Some scenes are truly worth seeing .
Imagine turning out the lights in your remote farmhouse on a cold night , and then going to bed . There 's no need to lock the doors . The only sound is the wind whistling through the trees . Sometime after midnight a car with lights off inches up the driveway . Moments later an intruder beams a flashlight into your darkened living room . What makes this image so scary is the setting : a remote farmhouse ... at night . Based on Truman Capote 's best-selling book , and with B & W lighting comparable to the best 1940 's noir films , `` In Cold Blood '' presents a terrifying story , especially in that first Act , as the plot takes place largely at night and on rain drenched country roads . It 's the stuff of nightmares . But this is no dream . The events really happened , in 1959 . Two con men with heads full of delusions kill an entire Kansas family , looking for a stash of cash that does n't exist . Director Richard Brooks used the actual locations where the real-life events occurred , even the farmhouse ... and its interior ! It makes for a memorable , and haunting , film . Both of the lead actors closely resemble the two real-life killers . Robert Blake is more than convincing as Perry Smith , short and stocky with a bum leg , who dreams of finding Cortez ' buried treasure . Scott Wilson is almost as good as Dick Hickock , the smooth-talking con artist with an all-American smile . After their killing spree , the duo head to Mexico . Things go awry there , so they come back to the U.S. , stealing cars , hitchhiking , and generally being miserable as they roam from place to place . But it 's a fool 's life , and the two outlaws soon regret their actions . The film 's final twenty minutes are mesmerizing , as the rain falls , the rope tightens , and all we hear is the pounding of a beating heart . Even with its somewhat mundane middle Act , `` In Cold Blood '' stages in riveting detail a real-life story that still hypnotizes , nearly half a century later . It 's that setting that does it . Do you suppose people in rural Kansas still leave their doors unlocked ... at night ?
The first time i saw it i got half of it but i watched and i knew later on it was about a salem witch trials . They focused on the Sara Good 's family . SHE is famous for cursing a priest which came true . In the film it depicts her daughter dorcas and her husband the spirit of Ann Putnam Sara 's husband comes to the future hunts this girl to redeem her soul . which does happen at the end of the movie . Dorcas is depict as witch at 5years old who is burned at the stake . Which never happen Ann putnam saves her from the flames . the girl is safe she goes to Ann putnam 's grave to to see that is not empty but it is at first because she accuse her of witchcraft , and lets her burn to death . Now that ann putnam saves her her spirit is redeemed , and she is not a outcast to society for the salem witch trials .
Ernst Marischka , one of the most respected Austrian directors of that time , made films full of beautiful scenes , delicate love and with respect to all that is precious in life . Nowadays , if people should hear about him , they associate the name of Marischka with SISSI trilogy ( 1955,1956,1957 ) . However , he made other excellent films like DAS DREIMADERLHAUS ( 1958 ) , EMBEZZLED HEAVEN ( 1958 ) and definitely this one , MADCHENJAHRE EINER KONIGIN showing the young years of queen Victoria . Although it deals with a slightly different theme than SISSI films , I do not see many differences between this movie and SISSI . They are strikingly similar . The movie is almost identical . The style , the music , the photography . In fact , the crew are almost the same . Anton Profes , Bruno Mondi ! The cast ... Romy Schneider 's one of the first main roles . It was a lovely introduction to her role of Sissi since this film was made one year before the first part of the trilogy about the Austrian empress . It is also a film where Romy plays with her mother , Magda Schneider . But Ernst Marischka was not the first director who cast Romy to play with her mum . Romy 's debut , WENN DER WEISSE FLIEDER WIEDER BLUHN ( 1953 ) was her performance with her mother , too . Therefore , there were some voices that Romy began her Austrian career on the bases of her mother 's fame . Indeed , there is some truth in it . Again , like in SISSI , this film shows love very gently . Victoria meets Prince Albert in a little inn in Dover . Their sympathy is based on pure exaltation in dance and gentle smiles . And now ... ? What would it be showed like ? Only sex ... But is it the only thing love is based on ? I am grateful to Ernst Marischka for these movies . They had a soul and a message . Some people may call them kitschy , but I will never give up admiring these films . They are IMPRESSIVE ! ! ! UNFORTUNATELY , HIGHLY UNDERRATED !
Halloween is one of the best examples of independent film . It 's very well made and has more psychological elements to it than you might realize at first glance . It is a simple movie told very well . The music is perfect and is one of the most haunting scores ... If you have n't seen this movie yet , you must check it out . The cast is all terrific . I wish they had never made sequel after sequel . The first one was by far the best and should have ended like it did without having a sequel . It was fun to see Jamie Lee Curtis in the movie . She has n't seemed to age ( she 's just as gorgeous today , without the hairdo and seventies clothes ) . The scenes through the mask are one of the scariest things ever !
A great storyline with a message . Joan Plowright is superb as `` Phoebe '' , Mike Kopsa is hilarious as `` coach '' and Richard de Klerk plays the role of `` Carmine '' superbly . Mischa Barton as `` Frankie '' puts in a good performance and Ingrid as `` Hazel '' plays her first lead extremely well . This film is superbly directed by Jo-Beth Williams . The editing is first rate .
`` Cut '' is a full-tilt spoof of the slasher genre and in the main it achieves what it sets out to do . Most of the standard slasher cliches are there ; the old creepy house , the woods , the anonymous indestructible serial killer , buckets of gore , and of course the couple interrupted by the killer while they 're having sex ( that 's hardly a spoiler ) . The set-up is simplicity itself : film-school nerds set out to complete an unfinished slasher `` masterpiece '' , unfinished because of the murders of a couple of the cast . This also neatly - okay , messily - disposes of Kylie Minogue in the first reel . They are joined by one of the survivors of the original film , played by Molly Ringwald who absolutely steals the film because she gets all the best lines . The rest of the cast fit their roles well , especially the lovely Jessica Napier , who plays it straight while the mayhem and gore erupt around her . There are plenty of red herrings and fake suspenseful moments , and there is very little time to try to work out who the killer is because the film moves at such a fast pace . It also has an appropriate low budget look , including some clumsy editing which is probably deliberate . Good soundtrack , too . If there is a difficulty with this film it is deciding whether it is a send-up of or a homage to the slasher genre . Probably a bit of both .
This film has been scaring me since the first day I saw it . My Mum had watched it when it was on the telly back in '92 . I remember being woken up in the middle of the night by her tearful ramblings as my Dad helped her up the stairs . She was saying something like `` Do n't let her get me '' or something like that . I asked what had made her so upset and she told me that she 'd been watching The Woman in Black . So obviously i had to watch it and even though i was only eleven she let me . It scared the s*** out of me . I 've been immune to horror films since watching this !
I have read with great interest the only available comment made before mine on this movie and I would first like to say that I understand the point of view of the previous user who commented on this movie very well : viewed from an Israeli perspective , I can very well imagine that this movie touches upon very sensitive issues and that the slightest detail can have a great importance for a viewer who is more or less directly concerned by the events depicted in this movie . What I would like to say is that 'Distortion ' was shown at a film festival in Geneva in November 2005 ( Festival 'Cinéma tout écran ' ) where it won the award of the audience ( 'Prix du public'in French ) . For what affects me , I liked the 'nervous camera ' work of Mr Bouzaglo , who , in my opinion , portrayed an atmosphere of extreme tension and uneasiness in the movie very well , and I think that most of the swiss viewers appreciated this in the movie . This perspective , however , might seem totally 'alien ' to an Israeli viewer , but not so surprising when it comes to swiss viewers , because Switzerland is a country which has NEVER been subject to any terrorist attack . It therefore comes as no surprise that the audience in Geneva judged this film with a much more 'detached ' perspective.I would also like to quote what Mr Bouzaglo said when he was interviewed by a Geneva newspaper ( I 'm translating from French ) : `` After 50 years of living here and after undergoing all this violence , we may ask ourselves if it is still possible to remain normal.We might sometimes think that it would be easier to commit suicide than to go on living . We are like the characters in my movie , ''on the edge of the edge '' . This is the reason why the private detective , who is somehow `` voyeur '' is the happiest character in the movie , because he earns a living thanks to the system , he takes advantage of this situation '' This is , in substance , the main thing that I and the swiss public , in my opinion , pointed out in this movie , and that we did not pay attention to some inconsistencies regarding the characters in the movie which the precedent reviewer pointed out with great accuracy and humor . So , to sum up , different country=different perspective , but I think that this is somehow great , because it reassures me for what affects the future of cinema , that is to say that it well never be subject to a 'unique ' of 'formatted ' way of thinking .
To fight against the death penalty is a just cause . Everyone who is sane in Europe would think so . In the USA everything is different . The film seems to demonstrate in a first stage that justice can be won against the racist bigot death penalty craving American justice . A young man is freed from death row thanks to a law professor who went back to defense counseling for this particular case . But the film has a sequel . Justice in the USA is entirely governed by the aim of vengeance . Miscarriage of justice is just the same governed by vengeance . One person in the local Public Attorney Offfice has a young man prosecuted on false charges . This Public Attorney 's officer drops the charges after a while and the young man walks out free . But he loses his college scholarship and he is castrated by some vengeful people for whom there is never any smoke without a fire . He hides his shame and swears to get his vengeance . But he also needs to satisfy his sexual needs which are more mental than hormonal for sure but even stronger because mental and no longer hormonal and he can only do that with little girls . He apparently teams with another serial killer who is after the same kind of preys . One day the local cops follow their intuition , guided by some vague circumstantial elements in the assassination of a young girl , and they arrest the young chap we are speaking of . They beat him up and interrogate him for 22 hours with nothing but blows and blows and telephone books and guns and Russian roulette . He confesses . Sent to death row , he asks his grandmother to go get the law professor in Massachusetts who is the husband of the Local Public Attorney 's representative that had him falsely prosecuted some years ago and the vengeance is on the rails . It will fail but it shows that as soon as one in the line of justice , police work and other security forces steps off the line of absolute legality , some unjust act is done that can ruin even the best accusation case and that can nourish the worst deepest imaginable thirst for vengeance . To charge someone on circumstantial elements is just as bad as to let circumstantial elements ruin the work of the police or of justice . The best intentions on the police side are ruined by some personal involvement and vengeful intention , just as much as the life of a person can be jeopardized by circumstantial elements inflated to the size of evidence , which in its turn will jeopardize the whole case by being just circumstantial , hence easily discardable , with a good lawyer . The film then is a deep reflection on the necessity to respect standards and regulations all along the police and justice line if we do n't want to make a mistake , which in its turn of course does not justify the death penalty since anyway it goes against the deepest belief Americans are supposed to have : `` We hold these truths to be self-evident , that all men are created equal , that they are endowed by their Creator with certain unalienable Rights , that among these are Life , Liberty , and the pursuit of Happiness . '' ( Declaration of Independence ) Life is an unalienable Right that was given to man by his Creator , which means no one but the one who gave it can take it away . Only God can take the life of a person away . The death penalty is the arrogant appropriation of a power that we do not have . Even if we do not evoke God , we can not justify the death penalty except as an act of vengeance , and here the film shows vengeance is the worst possible motivation in the rendition of justice and in the establishment of public peace . If vengeance is pushed aside there is no other justification for this death penalty . And there can always be a mistake in that pursuit not of Happiness but of vengeance .

An MGM MINIATURE Short Subject . The editor of the Cole County Clarion must decide what is the real IMPORTANT NEWS for his readers : an impending frost which may spell disaster to their crops , or the sensational shooting-down of a notorious gangster on their small town main street . This is an enjoyable little one-reeler , featuring a good performance by comic Charles ` Chic ' Sale . Today 's viewers will perhaps be more interested in the appearance of uncredited James Stewart , as Sale 's nephew/assistant . Slow talking & somewhat goofy , Stewart shows many of the attributes which would make him a huge star in a very short time . Often overlooked or neglected today , the one and two-reel short subjects were useful to the Studios as important training grounds for new or burgeoning talents , both in front & behind the camera . The dynamics for creating a successful short subject was completely different from that of a feature length film , something like writing a topnotch short story rather than a novel . Economical to produce in terms of both budget & schedule and capable of portraying a wide range of material , short subjects were the perfect complement to the Studios ' feature films .
This movie is witty , watchable and utterly touching . And now often do you get to see Jean Harlow ( or any actress of this era , for that matter ) give another woman a swift punch in the jaw ? ( Twice ! ) After Harlow 's Ruby is sent to a reformatory after getting mixed up with Gable 's Edward Hall ( he of that cheesy yet endearing crooked smile ) , her predicament becomes all the more complicated when she discovers that she is pregnant , and she 's convinced that this rake has abandoned her , but in fact , her love has reformed him and he comes to see her , despite the fact that he will be arrested , and from the help of a minister , are married . The wonderful relationship that Harlow shares with her fellow inmates is second only to her electric chemistry with Gable , who was her most frequent leading man . Her cynical character is a perfect match for Gable 's smooth-talking crook . What 's not to like ? `` You know , you would n't be a bad looking dame - if it was n't for your face ! '' Ruby cuttingly remarks to Gypsy , her rival . `` If you 're going to get that close to me , I 'll have to open the other window ! '' Priceless ! ! !
In what appears an attempt to mix drama and comedy , Manuel Gomez Pereira made this film , 'Things that make life worthwhile . `` It is not an original discovery , by many voice you have ( quite off the pitch , by the way ) , but it departs somewhat from the norm in the Spanish cinema . The downside is that the elements forming the film are poorly combined , and while some points are not well developed , others are out of place . A day in the lives of two people close to the median age . It 's basically what the movie Gómez Pereira . Jorge ( Eduard Fernandez ) is a stationary ( parado ) one which , despite load on your back with a drama major , seems willing to see things change . Only this explains his commitment to a minor could mean a turning point in its existence . In line with Audrey Tautou of 'Long dating ' ( Jean-Pierre Jeunet , 2004 ) , Jorge says things like this to herself : `` if I find a coin before the corner that is now going to change my luck. `` Of course it finds it , begins to play 'Today could be a great day ' ( Hoy puede ser un gran dia ) by Joan Manuel Serrat and in a few crosses on its way Hortensia ( Ana Belen ) .She is another woman entry age , divorced and a little lonely . Take valeriana for sleeping , organizes birthday parties as an exemplary mother , said her belief in God and leads to a speed of homicidal mother . Hortensia is a woman of many contradictions in his behavior , life was going in his head driving data as `` 70 % of people fall in love only once in a lifetime '' and said although it is short of Jorge and unemployed and does not preclude the possibility that it is a `` sadistic '' sleeping in his shoulder in the cinema at the earliest opportunity . Later came a communion , a dance in the luxurious wedding banquet , the back of a car and other things that players seem to live unique experiences like that but end up doing quite heavy for the viewer . 'Things that make life worthwhile ' debate between us is the drama of two adult persons who have no other that leads them to see where their strange relationship and , conversely , make us take the case as a comedy , focusing on things like a Chinese singing at a wedding ( which seem to be amusing in itself ) or the gait of a drunk person . The problem is that it does not leave us time to connect with the players , therefore we can not identify with the dramatic , and not give us a solid base comic too , leaving everything except pure joke . In the end , all mixed in a way that the viewer no longer know very well whether to laugh or mourn , and ends up not doing either . And it is true that something is not seen a thousand times , is not the kind of film that we find to bend every corner , but it is not sufficiently different or special as we want to do . Ana Belén ( which apparently far less than the 53 years that has in this film ) and Eduard Fernandez are two actors who are very enjoyable to see working , but this time it seems ready or comfortable enough in scenes that require him to break the calm that prevails in the film , so in moments like the `` accident '' with the children of the bar thing seems to be slipping from their hands . Perhaps a very dramatic change that has to do , but that is no excuse to lower our guard . In any case , both interpreters are erected easily the highlight of the function . 'Things that make life worthwhile ' work only up to the modest level of entertainment . Any claim that is beyond that point has not been fulfilled , as a romantic comedy or dramatic as that , we presume , they wanted to do , can not afford to have little moments finished successful ( beyond bad ) as that in which one of the characters talk and laugh , lost drunk , compared to a boy who remains in a coma in part because of him . Neither do much for people like Rosario Pardo , making the typical friend launched whose biggest contribution to the film is the phrase `` must be screwed over , '' and songs from the soundtrack , though significant , not just fit . It is true that the film by Manuel Gomez Pereira has its hits ( some of the moments involving Jose Sacristan ) , but the whole is a anodyne Story , a film with good intentions and a nice result when the better .
The biggest reason I had to see this movie was that it stars Susan Swift , an outstanding and all-too-underappreciated actress . Time travel movies usually do n't interest me and neither do movies about witchcraft , but this movie was fascinating and creepy . It did n't rely on outrageous special effects and it did n't focus so heavily on the time travel that the viewer gets lost and confused . This was a really creative movie kept simple and focused with great acting by all .
This movie grabbed me with the incredible opening sequence which tricked me into a complete reversal of perspective , so I was hooked by the time the title came on . The theme of this movie is that everyone is acting , trying to re-invent themselves , but not in a tricky way like Identity or the Usual Suspects , but in the way we all try to make whatever banal life we find ourselves in a little more interesting . The scenes in the chicken warehouses are spectacular . At one point Jorgen ( who owns the chicken farm ) attends a seminar in laughing , where he 's the worst student . His discomfort at this lets you see the depth of his yearning to change himself . The movie made me wonder about the hidden mysteries that lie behind the surface of the most commonplace people I see every day . There 's not a lot of plot here . Guessing the old man 's secret is pretty easy , but the fascination lies in trying to guess what all the other characters will do when they figure it out . This movie appealed to me in the same way that Sideways did , although the characters could n't be more dissimilar .
I was n't alive in the 60 's , so I ca n't guarantee that this movie was a completely accurate representation of the period , but it is certainly a moving and fulfilling experience . There are some excellent performances , most notably by Josh Hamilton ( of With Honors ) , Jerry O'Connell ( Sliders ) , who play brothers divided by the war . Bill Smitrovich , a character actor who has been long ignored by many , gives a heart-filled performance as their strict father , who is forced to question his own beliefs and values as one of his sons makes him proud by going to Vietnam but returns empty inside , while the other is exactly the opposite . All in all , this is a powerful and heartwarming film that I hope everyone gets a chance to experience .
Suraj Barjatya is best in movies on marriage . And here he is ; back to his basics on Vivaah . As the story goes this is a story from engagement to marriage . A movie you can watch with your entire family around you . A movie you will hate watching alone . The story is simple , but the music is good , cinematography is excellent , direction is best , everything about the movie has a class of its own . There are a lot of scenes which will make you cry and am sure if you are watching the movie with your sweetheart , you both are definitely going to hold each others hand till the end of the movie . Shahid & Amrita jodi has given us hit movies earlier like Ishq Vishq , & Shikhar . Though Shikhar was a good movie it was n't accepted well by the public.A truly Shahid & Amrita film .
This film was shot on location in Gerard Gardens in Liverpool , and was the UK 's answer to films such as 'Blackboard Jungle ' . The film stands the test of time quite well , with all the moral stories still ( or even more ) relevant today . The film feature some fine performance from some notable British actors such as David McCallum , Stanley Baker , Peter Cushing and Anne Heywood . Baker plays a Liverpool cop assigned to juvenile liaison duties , with the premise that if you catch the kids at an early age , they will end up being responsible adults . Notable cameos in the film include Freddie Starr ( Fred Fowell ) and Melvyn Hayes ( Gloria ) . Tsai Chin and Michael Chow play brother and sister ( they are real life brother and sister ) who are caught up in an arsonists web . Tsai Chin is still acting and can be seen in the latest Nicole Kidman film 'The Interpretor ' . Violent Playground features a gun siege in a school , so is unlikely to be shown on TV following similar events in Scotland / Russia . I lived in Gerard Gardens where the film was shot ( though was not born at the time ) , and have fond memories of the area . I have recently completed a documentary on Gerard Gardens which includes extracts from 'Violent Playground ' , and a small UK film 'Coast to Coast ' which stars Lenny Henry and Pete Postlewaite . The tenements were demolished in 1987 and the films go some way in keeping the memory alive . There were some complaints from the residents when the film was released , as the film portrayed the area in a bad light . Time has helped heal those wounds . A little gem of a film , I would recommend you seek this out
Cypher is a movie well worth seeing because it 's not the run-of-the-mill Sci-Fi flick . The artistic approach is painted with dark scenes and a kind of macro view of what 's going on . The close-up camera view is how the director keeps the plot illusive . The sci-fi aspect of the movie is secondary to the plot of the movie . The technology used in the movie is n't overly impressive , however , the director makes good use of the props . The character development is intentionally shallow . The main character , Jeremy Northam , decides to immerse himself into the world of espionage . It 's up to the audience to figure out his enigmatic character and it 's the enigma that keeps the audience interested right to the very end .
Now either you like Mr Carrey 's humour or you do n't . Me , Myself and Irene had audiences both walking out in droves and , on the other hand , cheering and collapsing in puddles of mirth . Bruce Almighty is a bit more mainstream , but you have been warned . If you 're not sure , watch the trailer . I saw the trailer three times and still laughed at the same gags when I saw the film . If you do n't find the sight of a dog putting the seat down after using the loo funny , do n't bother with the movie . Carrey , a reporter stuck in a rut covering 'lighter news ' berates God when the whole of his life seems to be going to pot . God takes up the challenge and asks Carrey if he can do better . Carrey gets into the swing of having all of God 's powers by making his girlfriend ( Jennifer Aniston ) 's breasts bigger , getting himself promoted , and answering everyone 's prayers by single stroke computer commands . This is not a highbrow movie or even that memorable , but it is very well made within it 's very limited intent , provides almost continuous laughs to Carrey fans , and even any religious cheesiness is likely to be inoffensive to all but the most narrow-minded god-squadders and anti-god-squadders . On the more thoughtful level , the film tempts us to speculate about Carrey 's own career - stuck in his 'comedy ' typecasting he has largely failed to make an impression as a serious actor even after winning two Golden Globes . His most accomplished 'straight ' role , the Man on the Moon , is less well known that his comedy romps - or The Truman Show ( on which the Academy heaped three nominations whilst bypassing Carrey ) .
It might be a little erroneous to open a review by describing a film in terms of other films , but I think it 's the best way to give an approximation of the place Election occupies in the gangster genre arena . It works somewhere in between The Godfather and Kinji Fukasaku 's yakuza opus The Yakuza Papers ( AKA Battles Without Honour and Humanity ) , in that it is simultaneously both romanticized and realistic , dark and gritty . But it 's also a Johnnie To film , and as such it carries the distinct touch of the Hong Kong auteur . Every two years the HK Triad elects a new boss . Only this time one of the candidates is not overly happy with the result so he decides to take matters into his own hands much to the dismay of the rest of the Triads and the police . That 's the story in a nutshell but rest assured it has a lot more going for it than that . As in The Yakuza Papers , there 's a great deal of scheming , back-stabbing and forming and switching of allegiances ( sometimes all it takes is a phone call - in one of the most memorable scenes I 've seen in recent time ) which might not necessarily make for deep drama but makes for an interesting plot and good character conflict . Fans of the gangster genre are likely to appreciate it in that aspect . Election is not as action-oriented as one might expect ; although it IS violent . And I 'm not talking about the glossy , glamour version of Hollywood violence . This is dark and grim . To 's camera lingers in the scenes of people being brutalized in ways that reveal both the humanity and inhumanity of the perpetrators and victims ; after all violence IS an integral part of us whether we like it or not . If you 're familiar with To 's style , then you should know what to expect . The pacing is relatively slow and deliberate . The cinematography is great , slick and dark in equal measures , utilizing dark hues ( brown , dark green and orange ) while the smooth tracking shots add a vibrant quality to it . In the end , Election occupies a peculiar place . It 's not exactly a character study and it 's not an action-oriented gangster film . It explores a situation ( the election and its aftermath ) , but does so in style , and is both realistic and romanticized ( the Triad ceremonies in particular echo of an oriental Godfather ) .
This film is really cool . every thing looks like it came out of the comic book . the sets , the costumes , and the plot is great . Clark Bartram is again our favorite batman . he looked a bit better in dead end , but he still pulls it off . superman is great too . the flying effects are OK. but its a fan-film so we cant expect them to be the greatest . the shot with superman catching the car was VERY believable . it was cool . This is a movie i would definitely see if it were real . its got every thing you would want in a batman/ superman movie . one exception though , i would cast the joker instead of 2-face ... .. overall i give this film a 10 because its a great film .
I 'm an admirer of Hal Hartley 's films , especially 1997 's `` Henry Fool . '' `` Fay Grim '' is a sequel to that film , and has a similar style and sense of humor . The plot , however , is completely different . Fay Grim ( played brilliantly by the iconic Parker Posey ) tries to track down her missing husband 's notebooks , and finds herself amid conspiracies and espionage . The supporting cast ( most of the folks from the first film as well as Jeff Goldblum , Saffron Burrows , and a much-welcomed return from 90s indie-darling Elina Lowensohn ) is excellent and the film has lots of surprises . The director claims this is part of a `` Star Wars '' -like trilogy , serving as the `` Empire Strikes Back '' of the series If this is true , I ca n't wait to see the third installment ! I just hope I do n't have to wait 10 more years for it .
Well , when before I saw this film I really was n't sure whether it would be my cup of tea ... how wrong I was ! I thought that this was one of the best films I 've watched for a very long time , a real family classic . The story of a young evacuee and his new 'foster ' dad , this film ticks all the boxes . I 've not read the book ( maybe that 's a good thing & meant I enjoyed the film more ) but with regards to the story , I really ca n't think of any bad points , hence scoring it 10 out of 10 ( and I hardly ever think anything warrants top marks ! ) . By the time William proclaimed 'I CAN RIDE MY BIKE , DAD ! ' I was sobbing my heart out ( anyone who 's seen it will understand , I 'm sure ) . Really heartwarming , and definitely recommended .
More like psychological analysis of movies , but Psycho does sound better as a header . The man in charge of the movie ( the narrator if you will ) does depict movies here in his own way . Most of them are classics , but all of them are listed here at IMDb and I 'd strongly advise you to see them ( especially the Hitchcock movies , Solyaris , Conversation & and the Lynch movies ) , because Slavoj Zizek will reference them ! Or in other words , he might spoil them for you . I do n't remember if he spoiled more than those I 've listed ( I think the Chaplin movies too ) , but as I wrote it 'd be best if you watch them all beforehand ! In the IMDb listing there is a movie missing , that I did report to them , so it might get up there pretty soon . It 's a Meg Ryan movie , but it 's a only a brief snippet not big of a deal anyways . Zizek views and opinions are crazy and fun to listen to , if you 're open minded to see things through another perspective ( even if that does destroy your favorite movie a bit for you ... it does n't mean it will do that , but it could ) !
Was this based on a comic-book ? A video-game ? A drawing by a 3 year-old ? There is nothing in this movie to be taken seriously at all ; not the characters , not the dialog , not the plot , not the action . Nothing . We have high-tech international terrorists/criminals who bicker like pre-school kids , Stallone 's man-of-steel-type resilience towards ice-cold weather , dialog so dumb that it 's sometimes almost hilarious , and so on . Even the codename that the bad guys use is dumb ( `` tango-tango '' ) . A film that entertains through some suspense , good action-sequences , and a nice snowy mountainous setting . Oh , yes : and the unintentional humour . The film opens with some truly bad and unconvincing gay banter between our go-lucky and happy characters who are obviously having a `` swell '' time . Then comes a sweat-inducing failed-rescue part , which should make anyone with fear-of-heights problems want to pull their hair out . And then we have some more bad dialog , and after that some more great action . This is the rhythm of the film in a nutshell . Stallone 's melodramatic exchange with Turner , when they meet after a long time , is so soapy , so clichéd , so fake , and so bad that it should force a chuckle out of any self-respecting viewer . Soon after this display of awful dialog-writing , we are witnesses to a spectacular and excellently shot hijack of an airplane . The entire action is one big absurdity , but it 's mindless fun at its best . Although the rest of the action is exciting and fun , the airplane scenes are truly the highlight of the film . After the landing , our master-criminals seek for a guide and end up with Stallone and Rooker . They send Stallone to fetch the first case of money , but somehow they do everything to make it as difficult as possible for him to reach it ; they take most of his clothes off ( so he can freeze ) and they wo n't give him the equipment he needs ( so he can fall off ) . DO THESE GANGSTERS WANT THEIR MONEY FETCHED OR NOT ? ? ? Very silly . Apparently they do n't trust Stallone , but surely they know that they can always black-mail him by using Rooker as a hostage . Nevertheless , our gangsters make Stallone 's climb difficult , if for no logical reasons then to at least show us how truly evil they are - lest there be any doubts . And for those who might still doubt how evil the bad guys are , they overact , brag , and snicker in a truly evil manner . Everyone convinced ? Good . You 'd better be . Otherwise the writers will throw in a mass execution of twenty school children , just to make sure that the evilness of the bad guys is crystal-clear to everyone . The old guy who flies the chopper ... How the hell did he fall for the trap ? Firstly , he must have been warned by the MTV airhead about the criminals , and secondly , he must have heard Stallone 's and Rooker 's voices on the walkie-talkies . A whole bunch of idiotic verbal exchanges take place , with Lithgow having the questionable honour of getting most of the silly lines . `` Get off my back ! '' Lithgow : `` I have n't even started climbing on your back . '' Or , Lithgow to Stallone : `` We had a deal , but now we only have each other ! '' And as for Lithgow 's gang of murderers : these guys never seem to want to kill immediately . They are very creative about it ; they philosophize , pretend that they are playing football with your body , and so on . Stallone co-wrote this thing . I have no idea what drugs he was on when he did it . I 'd hate to think the script is this bad because of a low I.Q .
A young woman comes to the home town of his husband after he passed away in an accident . She barely settles down in this small town , but shortly after , loses her little son in a kidnapping and all her hopes ... This could lead to all kinds following plots in a normal movie : find a new partner and being happy finally ; or depressed enough to struggle and finally kill herself ... She does try to kill herself , but not after a series of severe fights , with God . She trusts in God , only to find that God seems to forgive everyone , even the killer . Well , I should be careful here about God , the movie does n't mean a thing against God . The way the movie deals the issue is quite interesting : not in the woman 's point of view or from God 's perspective ( in this way , there would be lots of grass growing , clouds flying views , I suppose ) . Rather , it 's from a third party 's eye , the movie let us to perceive and does n't explain a thing . The movie would n't be so interesting were there only the woman . There 's this man who 's everywhere around the woman and obviously in love with her , but in his own way . He 's a funny guy , like a clown I should say , who shamelessly hangs around our heroine . The combination of these two , the woman full of tension , crying and throwing up always , and the man , smiling and talking stupidly , ends up in a good balance of emotions : nothing absurdly wrong or too tedious . Highly recommend .
EXTREMITIES is the disturbing , yet riveting screen version of a play by William Mastriosimone ( who adapted his own play for the screen ) about a woman who is attacked in her car one night by a would-be rapist on her way home and is terrified when she realizes the man got her purse and knows where she lives . After her roommates leave for work the next day , the guy shows up at her home and attempts to rape her . The story takes a surprising twist when , at one point , the woman turns the tables on the man and is able to overpower him ; but when she realizes there is no way that attempted rape can be proved and if the man is arrested , he will just get off , she decides to keep him prisoner in the house until she can get a confession out of him . Far-fetched ? Maybe . Disturbing ? Definitely , but there 's a wonderfully claustrophobic feel about this film , especially the middle with just the woman and her attacker , that you ca n't help but feel completely a part of what 's going on . I did not see the play on Broadway , but I would imagine a piece like this works better onstage , but that does n't make this film any less riveting an experience . Farrah Fawcett , one of the last actresses to do the role on Broadway , was awarded the role of Marjorie in the film version and delivers a taut and deeply moving performance as the victim who refuses to be a victim . Many critics found Fawcett 's performance to be one-note , but for me , Marjorie is a woman completely numbed by what she has been through and the performance works for me . James Russo , in the performance of his career , is slimy and menacing as the would-be rapist who finds Marjorie to be much more of a challenge than he assumed . Alfre Woodard and Diana Scarwid co-star as Marjorie 's roommates , who come home after Marjorie has overpowered the guy and has him tied up and stuffed in their fireplace upon their arrival . And it 's the arrival of the roommates that take the story to an unexpected level because they did n't see what we saw Marjorie go through and therefore , think she should call the police and let them handle the guy . Not for the faint of heart , but if you can stand it , a gripping film experience anchored by a lead performance that will surprise you .
This has to be one of the most beautiful , moving , thought provoking films around . It 's good family entertainment and at the same time makes you think very hard about the issues involved . Every time I see the `` ghost of Zac riding the bike through the puddle at the end I ca n't help but cry my eyes out . John Thaw 's performance is so touching and it is a shame he is no longer with us . Gone but not forgotten . A outstanding film . Full marks .
***SPOILERS*** All too , in real life as well as in the movies , familiar story that happens to many young men who are put in a war zone with a gun , or rifle , in their hands . The case of young and innocent , in never handling or firing a gun , Jimmy Davis , Franchot Tone , has been repeated thousands of times over the centuries when men , like Jimmy Davis , are forced to take up arms for their country . Jimmy who at first wanted to be kicked out of the US Army but was encouraged to stay , by being belted in the mouth , by his good friend Fred P. Willis , Spencer Tracy , ended up on the front lines in France . With Jimmy 's unit pinned down by a German machine gun nest he single handedly put it out of commission picking off some half dozen German soldiers from the safety of a nearby church steeple . It was when Jimmy gunned down the last surviving German , who raised his arms in surrender , that an artillery shell hit the steeple seriously wounding him . Recovering from his wounds at an Army hospital Jimmy fell in love with US Army volunteer nurse Rose Duffy , Gladys George . Rose was really in love with Jimmy 's good friend the happy go lucky Fred despite his obnoxious antics towards her . It 's when Fred was lost during the fighting on the Western Front that Rose , thinking that he was killed , fell in love and later married Jimmy . When Fred unexpectedly showed up in the French town where Jimmy , now fully recovered from his wounds , was stationed at things got very sticky for both him and Rose who had already accepted Jimmy 's proposal of marriage to her ! With WWI over and Jimmy marrying Rose left Fred , who 's still in love with her , a bitter and resentful young man . It was almost by accident that Fred ran into Jimmy on the streets of New York City and discovered to his shock and surprise that he completely changed from the meek and non-violent person that he knew before he was sent to war on the European Western Front . Smug and sure of himself , and his ability to shoot a gun , Jimmy had become a top mobster in New York City 's underworld ! Not only that but as Fred later found out his wife Rose had no idea what Jimmy was really involved in with Jimmy telling her that he works as a law abiding and inoffensive insurance adjuster . Jimmy 's life of crime came full circle when Rose , after she found out about his secret life , ratted him out to the police to prevent him from executing a `` Valentine Day '' like massacre , with his gang members dressed as cops , of his rival mobsters . While on trial Jimmy came to his senses and admitted his guilt willing to face the music and then , after his three year sentence is up , get his life back together . ***SPOILER ALERT*** Hearing rumors from fellow convicts that Rose and his best friend Fred were having an affair behind his back Jimmy broke out of prison ending up a fugitive from the law . It 's at Fred 's circus , where he works as both manger and barker , that Jimmy in seeing that Rose as well as Fred were true to him that he , like at his trial , had a sudden change of heart . But the thought of going back to prison , with at least another ten years added on to his sentence , was just too much for Jimmy ! It was then that Jimmy decided to end it all by letting the police who by then tracked him down do the job , that he himself did n't have the heart to do , for him !
One of the best ( if not the best ) Stephen King 's screenings . Dark as dark can be , surprising non-hollywood ending , terrifying atmosphere , amazing book adaptation , outstanding cast , educational ( do n't play with afterlife ) , in short - everything an excellent horror should be ... My favorite horror movie , straight 10+ .
I knew I was going to see this when I saw the first preview . Dennis Quaid was one reason , but the theme of holding on to your dreams speaks to me . People talk about this as a movie for kids , but I think it 's a movie for baby boomers who are coming to terms with aging , infirm parents , our own mortality , our kids growing up and leaving us , and all the other things we never thought would happen to us . The movie does n't fall into the trap of tragedy ; it 's about what living your dreams means when you have a real life . Quaid is too small for a pitcher but he makes it look good , and Rachel Griffiths makes a small part as the wife into a thoughtful , layered performance . The camera-work is slow and sweet . When they put this movie together , they left out anything that was n't necessary . Very nice .
The final chapter in the Hanzo the Razor trilogy provides fitting closure for this entertaining series of samuraisploitation . Inoue replaces Yasuzu Masumura ( Blind Beast , Red Angel , Manji ) in the director 's chair , but the style is pretty much the same , perhaps due to Shintaro Katsu serving as the producer , apart from the titular antihero . Hanzo uncovers a female ghost who is guarding treasure hidden in the bottom of the lake . Of course , Hanzo being Hanzo , he 's not put off by the fact she 's a ghost , so he proceeds to rape ... ahem , interrogate her , using the now familiar revolving net device . The plot takes through a series of blind monks who also doubletime as loansharks , corrupt officials , promiscuous wives and the necessary hack and slash . Hanzo 's superior officer , Onishi , and his two servants , provide the typical comedic notes , and generally , it 's business as usual . Significantly less convoluted and easier to follow than the first ( which is all over the place and a bit of a mess ) , less stylish , dramatic and bloody than the second ( arguably the finest in the Hanzo series ) , but still entertaining and worthwhile on its own merits . Complete with trademark training sequences , the obligatory rape , swordfights , and a mystery Hanzo is called upon to investigate , this will ultimately satisfy the fans .
Henri Verneuil 's film may be not so famous as Parallax View , 3 Days of the Condor or JFK but it is certainly not worse and sometimes even better than these classic representatives of the genre . Action takes place in fictional western state where fictional president has been killed . After several years of investigation , special government commission decides that president was killed by a lone gunman . But one man - prosecutor Volney , played by Yves Montand - thinks there 's something more to be investigated and so the film starts . This movie does n't deal with some exact theories , but it embraces the whole structure of relationship between government and society in today 's world . Such film could be made only in the 1970-ies but it will never lose it 's actuality . Furthermore , it 's even a bit frightful how precise are it 's oracles . 10 out of 10 .
There 's the danger with the critic/philosopher Slavoj Zizek with his film , directed by Sophie Fiennes , which takes together a wonderful amalgam of silent , horror , sci-fi , surreal and other contemporary thrillers together to make his points ofr Freudian comparisons to overload . But in the Pervert 's Guide to Cinema he also makes even the more far-reaching points a point of departure from any other analysis I 've seen on a collective section of films . While it does n't cover the expansive territory Scorsese 's movie documentaries cover , the same attachments are there , and Zizek has a definite love for all of these `` perverse '' examples and films , primarily the work of Hitchcock , Lynch , Chaplin and Tarkovsky . Yet one should n't go into seeing this- if you can find it that is , I got to see it almost by luck- thinking Zizek will just try and dissect all of the psycho-sexual parts or parts referring it in an obtuse , deranged manner . If anything he opens up one to points that might never be considered otherwise- would one think of three of the Marx brothers as representations of the Id , Super-Ego and Ego ( Harpo 's example is most dead-on for me ) . He 's not just one to take on the classics though , he also considers the food for thought in The Matrix and Fight Club- in representations of the split between fantasy and reality and if the matrix needs the energy as much as the energy needs the matrix for the former , and in the attachment of violence in dealing with one 's own self as well as ones double in the latter . He even throws in a piece from the pivotal moment in Revenge of the Sith when Anakin becomes Darth Vader , and the implications of shunning away fatherhood under that back mask at the very moment his children 's births happens elsewhere . The ideals of fatherhood , male sexuality , the male point of view in turning fantasy into reality ( at which point Zizek rightfully points to as the moment of a nightmare 's creation ) , and female subjectivity , are explored perhaps most dead-on with Vertigo . This too goes for a scene that Zizek deconstructs as if it 's the Zapruder film , where he dissects the three colliding points of psycho-sexual stance in the 'do n't you look at me ' scene in Blue Velvet . Now it would be one thing if Zizek himself went about making these sincere , excited , and somehow plausible points just face on to the camera or mostly in voice-over as Scorsese does . But he goes a step further to accentuate his points of fantasy and reality , and how they overlap , intersect , become one and the same , or spread off more crucially into some netherworld or primordial feeling for some characters ( i.e . Lost Highway ) by putting himself IN the locations the films take place in . Funniest is first seeing him in the boat `` heading '' towards the same dock Tippi Hedren 's boat heads to at the beginning of the Birds ; equally funny is as he waters the Blue Velvet lawn he goes on to explain the multi-faceted points of Frank Booth ; only one , when he 's in Solaris-like territory , does it seem a little cheesy . But Zizek seems to be having a lot of fun with this set-up , and after a while one bypasses the potential crux of this gimmick and Zizek 's words come through . There were some films I of course would 've expected , chiefly from Hitchcock and Lynch , but a treat for movie buffs come from seeing two things- the movies that one would never think of seeing in a film about films titled the Pervert 's Guide of Cinema ( top two for me would be the Disney Pluto cartoon and the exposition on Chaplin 's films , albeit with a great note about the power and distinction of 'voice ' ) , and the ones that one has n't seen yet ( i.e . the ventriloquist horror film , Dr. Mabuse , Stalker , among a few others ) that inspire immediate feelings of 'wow , I have to see that immediately , no questions asked . ' Zizek is a powerful writer with his work , and puts it forward with a clarity that reminds one why we watch movies in the first place , to be entertained , sure , but also to have that actual experience of sitting down and having something up there , as he put it , looking into a toilet . It 's probably one of the greatest films about cinema , and in such a splendidly narrow analysis of how Freud works its way into films regarding desire , the Id/Super-Ego/Ego , and of the supernatural in fantasy , that you may never see ... unless distribution finally kicks in , if only on the smallest levels .
I bought this a while ago but somehow neglected to watch it until last night . I do like Juliette Lewis although I 'm indifferent to Brad Pitt . After this viewing I have to admit he 's a perfectly fine actor - his character was entirely believable , and I did n't think `` Brad Pitt '' at all . Unfortunately I ca n't say the same for David Duchovny . I 'm an X-Files fan and I had to look twice to confirm the date of this movie , as I 'd thought it was made a few years later . I like Duchovny but found his character a little two-dimensional here , except where he 's doing voice-overs . That part was strong , seemed in character , good intonation , etc . Otherwise I kept thinking `` Agent Mulder '' , which is a pity . Michelle Forbes was a treat . Why have n't I noticed her before ? ( I 'll be looking up to see what other roles she 's done and seeing those asap ) I am slightly concerned about stereotyping re Lewis , this film , and `` Natural Born Killers '' ( a firm favourite ) . Interesting though to see a contrast of characters - in NBK she 's a willing accomplice , whereas here she abhors the violence and tries very hard not to acknowledge Early 's dark side until it 's thrust in her face . I enjoyed this film almost unreservedly . Apart from Duchovny 's character not seeming fully-formed ( and perhaps being `` washed out '' somewhat by Pitt 's ) , it was perfect . I was also pleased with the ending - glad that the innocent heroes did not die , yet they had to suffer first . It was realistic , tense , disturbing . If you like NBK you may well like this movie , and vice-versa .
FORBIDDEN PLANET is the best SF film from the golden age of SF cinema and what makes it a great film is its sense of wonder . As soon as the spaceship lands the audience - via the ships human crew - travels through an intelligent and sometimes terrifying adventure . We meet the unforgetable Robbie , the mysterious Dr Morbuis , his beautiful and innocent daughter Altair and we learn about the former inhabitants of the planet - The Krell who died out overnight . Or did they ? You can nitpick and say the planet is obviously filmed in a movie studio with painted backdrops but that adds to a sense of menace of claustraphobia I feel and Bebe and Louis Barron ` s electronic music adds even more atmosphere I ` m shocked this film isn ` t in the top 250 IMDB films .
I actually really like what I 've seen of this cartoon so far . Sure , the animation is n't the best , but frankly , I 'd rather see this type of more cartoony style done quickly and cheaply than the old type of style done quickly and cheaply ( which was starting to happen more and more often -- it 's only a style that looks good when a lot of time and effort is put into it ) . There 's nothing wrong with the angular lines and the little black-dot eyes -- in fact , I think it 's really cute . As a kid I never thought Scooby-Doo 's design was particularly adorable , but I think I might like it better know . Anyway , Shaggy has always been my favorite character , and believe it or not , but I think he has the most potential for some depth . Sure , the show does n't center around the original `` Mystery-solving '' theme , but that was just a tired old formula anyway . Do n't get me wrong -- I 'm sure there are writers out there who would be able to bring a lot more interest to Mystery Inc. 's traditional pursuits ( which has been lacking as late ) , but in the mean time this show is a fun deviation from the standard . Shaggy and Scooby are still funny , but no longer only comic relief . They 're still cowardly , but finally have the opportunity to use what seems to be ( shock ! ) intelligence . They 're the same old over-eating slackers as ever , but now actually seem to be getting on with their lives with the help of Uncle Albert 's inheritance . I used to find most original Scooby-Doo jokes to be pure cheese and unintentionally hilarious at best , but this show actually exercises a capacity for real humor . Also , I never really like Casey Kasem as Shaggy anyway , so the new actor does n't annoy me as much as he does other people . ( I still think Billy West was the best , though ) Overall , while not a great cartoon in the scope of all of cartoon history , still an achievement among other Scooby incarnations .
Tony Hawk Underground came at a point where the series was really starting to lose its luster , Tony Hawk Pro Skater 4 did not live up to expectations and left the series really up in the air on what Neversoft and Activision could do with the series that would be different and interesting . Underground introduced the storymode , which was very cool because it made a whole new world for Tony Hawk Pro Skater fans . Another feature introduced which fans pretty much argued for and that was being able to get off the skateboard , which is nice because now you can actually climb , run , and do all sorts of new things . The levels are good , Neversoft also improved on an issue that started with Pro Skater 3 and that was the length of the level designs . The first two games for the PS1 , N64 and Dreamcast were great because the levels were nice and long and some hidden features in some . Pro Skater 3 and 4 were shortened because of a handful of features that were added and really pushed the systems too their limits . In this version , they shortened those features , there is n't as many people wondering the streets , in fact there are almost none in some levels , and the graphics and the skating physics are toned down a little but not a lot . This game does have one con , the storymode is a little short , of course this is Neversofts first time doing this with Tony Hawk Pro Skater , so that is understandable . However , with that being said you will definitely finish this game within a day . Overall , a great addition that was very refreshing .
I missed almost all of the first season , but when the other shows went to reruns , I started watching . I ended up buying the entire first season off iTunes . This is now one of my favorite comedy shows . Patrick Warburton is the key . His dry sense of humor has me rolling all the time . David Spade is funny , but sometimes a little Russell goes a long way . I enjoy the other cast members more ( but not saying he does n't add to the show ) . Do yourself a favor . If you have n't checked this one out , give it a try . If you can catch the episode where `` Jeff '' goes to the sperm bank , you will see how good this show is . I hope this series has a long run .
COME ON ! ! ! They did that on purpose ! ! Two of my current faves on TV ( Meloni from `` Oz '' and `` L and O-SVU '' and Janel from `` West Wing '' ) hook up for a nice little sleeper/character study . Plot 's nothing fancy , but the acting is right on the mark . Tim Busfield shows up for some neat bits . Worth a look .
This game is amazing . Really , you should get it if you do n't have it . Although it is ancient now it was amazing when it came out . I believe that this game will always be a classic . It 's just as good a Super Mario World or so . When I was young , my friend and I would sit and play this game for hours trying to beat it which we eventually did . It 's not nearly as advanced as Super Mario Galaxy , but if you are a fellow Mario fan it is essential . It 's fun entertaining and challenging . Everything you could want out of a fantasy game except for good graphics , ( well it did come out in 1996 . ) ROCK ON 4EVA MARIO LUIGI AND YOSHI ! ! ! Nintendo is the best !
I was never a big fan of horror movies . They usually try cheap tricks to scare their audiences like loud noises and creepy children . They usually lack originality and contain overacting galore . The only horror movie i like was Stir of Echoes with Kevin Bacon . It was well-acted , and had a great story . But it has been joined and maybe even surpassed by Stanley Kubrick 's The Shining , quite possibly the scariest movie ever . The movie follows a writer ( Jack Nicholson ) and his family who agree to watch over a hotel while it is closed for the winter . There were rumors of the place being haunted and the last resident went crazy and murdered his family . But Jack is convinced it will be OK and he can use the quiet to overcome his writer 's block . After months of solitude and silence however , Jack becomes a grumpy and later violent . Is it cabin fever or is there something in the hotel that is driving him mad ? One of the creepiest parts about the movie is the feeling of isolation that Kubrick makes . The hotel is very silent , and the rooms are huge , yet always empty . It is also eerily calm when Jack 's son is riding his bike through the barren hallways . Jack Nicholson 's performance is also one of his very best , scaring the hell out of me and making me sure to get out once in awhile . My favorite scene is when he is talking to a ghost from inside a walk-in refrigerator . The Shining is tops for horror movies in my opinion , beating the snot out of crap like the Ring and The Blair Witch Project . It may be a oldie , but is definitely a goodie . 8/10
Although The Notorious Bettie Page is well acted and shot , is is , at best , a Cliffs Notes version of Bettie 's biography . The film mainly centers on her work with Irving and Paula Klaw , the brother and sister team who produced the bulk of her most famous photos . It does not detail her life after posing , aside from her religious rebirth . It cites `` The Real Bettie Page '' , by Richard Foster as a source , but it ignores Bettie 's later years of mental illness and incarceration in a mental hospital . The narrow focus of the biography can be debated , but the majority of Bettie 's fans and the `` civilians '' would probably be more interested in her modeling career , which is what they get . The film is well acted , with Gretchen Mol faithfully reproducing the look of Bettie , as well as conveying the sweetness that her photos exuded . The character is played as rather naive , a probable byproduct of interviews given by Bettie in recent years . It is more likely that Bettie was aware of the nature of her photos but rationalized it as acting and costumes . The supporting cast is also outstanding , with Chris Bauer and Lili Taylor playing Irving and Paula Klaw , and David Strathairn as Estes Kefauver . The film errs with the character of John Willie , played by Jared Harris . John Willie never met Bettie Page and was not involved in photo shoots with the Klaws . Harris plays Willie a bit like Peter O'Toole , in his more debauched state . Despite the quality of acting , the film is a bit of a disappointment in terms of depth . The story is rather cursory and we never feel that we truly get to know Bettie . Much like her photos , it 's just an image . It does tend to exaggerate Bettie 's notoriety . Her photos were mainly seen in and around New York , in a very narrow market of underground and cultish publications . Her real fame came after her photos were reprinted in the late 70 's and 80 's , and the Cult of Betty Page ( as her name was usually spelled ) grew . Bettie 's greatest exposure ( pardon the pun ) was in Playboy , appearing in the January 1955 issue ( the Christmas photo , which is staged in reverse in the film ) . The film is well done , if rather shallow . It is able to sustain interest until the end and showcases many fine performances . It hits the high points of Bettie 's life , but ignores many details which would have given it far greater depth . The ending is rather a let down . It feels rather abrupt . Still , the movie is definitely worth viewing by anyone interested in Bettie , or even the time period . The soundtrack is great , really pulling the viewer into the 1950 's . If nothing else , the film stands as a showcase for America 's burgeoning sexuality and the clash with its Puritan past . It 's also a peek at an icon for both men and women .
This movie strikes me as one of the most successful attempts ever at coming up with plausible answers for some of the nagging questions that have cropped up in recent scholarship concerning the `` Passion '' ( suffering and death of Christ ) accounts in the New Testament . ( What motivated Judas if money was not the issue ? What could bring the Sanhedrin to meet on a high holy day ? Why did Pilate waffle ? ) It is a movie for the serious , thinking Christian : fans of `` The Passion of the Christ '' will no doubt be disappointed by the lack of gory spectacle and arch characterization . As for myself , I find the portrait painted here -- of the willingness of ordinary people to so blithely sacrifice common decency when their own self-interest is at stake -- far more realistic and deeply unsettling . ( The disinterested , `` just doing my job '' look on the face of the man who drives the first nail in Christ 's wrist is as chilling as any moment in film . ) The film makes no claim to `` authenticity '' , but the settings and costuming invariably feel more `` right '' than many more highly acclaimed efforts . It is a slow film but , if you accept its self-imposed limits ( it is , after all , `` The Death '' -- not the Life -- '' of Christ '' ) , ultimately a very rewarding one .
Bill and Ted are back , only this time an evil dude from the future has sent back an evil Bill and Ted to destroy them , thus destroying 'Wyld Stallions ' and the basis for human society in the future . This time Bill and Ted have to travel through the afterlife 'Totally Bogus ' and save humanity 'Excellent ' With much of the same zany humour and some wonderful new characters like the grim reaper , station and robot Bill and Ted ( stations creation ) Bogus Journey once again entertains , and is worth watching for its soundtrack alone . 7/10 A most triumphant sequel Party on Dudes ! Hehe
Gary Busey is the title character , Frank `` Bulletproof '' McBain , your standard-issue reckless maverick cop who 's earned his nickname because no matter how many bullets he takes ( 38 and counting ) , he never stops going after the bad guys . When a cutting-edge U.S. tank dubbed `` Thunderblast '' is driven across the border into Mexico , it 's nabbed by revolutionaries / terrorists led by General Brogado ( Rene Enriquez ) and Libyan Colonel Kartiff ( Henry Silva ) , who 's aligned himself with Russian villains . The Army personnel involved are kept as prisoners , chief among them Devon Shepard ( Darlanne Fluegel ) , who happens to be McBain 's ex-girlfriend . McBain is then recruited by the Army for a rescue mission . Busey may not have the physical presence of say , someone like Schwarzenegger , who would have been another appropriate lead for a film of this type , but he 's a blast as a self- confident dude who 's quick with the wisecracks . Fluegel is a great female lead ; she not only looks incredibly sexy but makes for a fine butt-kicking action babe . Enriquez , Silva , Juan Fernandez , and the always welcome William Smith ( as a Russian major ) are loathsome scum in the classic action movie tradition . The supporting cast is quite full of familiar and reliable character actors : L.Q . Jones , R.G . Armstrong , Thalmus Rasulala , Lincoln Kilpatrick , Mills Watson , Luke Askew , Danny Trejo , and Cary-Hiroyuki Tagawa . T.L . Lankford and B.J . Goldman supply the script , based on a story by Lankford and veteran B director Fred Olen Ray . It 's the kind of script where you just know the writers have their tongues in their cheeks : they know their material is absurd and cheesy , and just have fun throwing credibility out the window . Veteran action director Steve Carver keeps it moving and delivers a respectable amount of gunfire , explosions , and general all-out mayhem . `` Bulletproof '' is good fun for the action fan who does n't mind switching off their brain now and then and just enjoying a generous assortment of violence and humor . 7/10
... This is n't the first time Stanley blurred the distinction between genres to such great effect , either . In Dr. Strangelove you had a comedy about a horrific situation , and here the basis is a terrifying scenario which actually yields some very funny moments . Slow-burning madness and attempting to kill one 's family is n't hilarious of course , but the dialogue is very knowing ( `` five months of peace is just what I want ... `` ) and there is a terrific drinking scene which would be riotous if you included just one type of spirit , but is spine-chilling when you factor in the other . I disagree with those who say that the hotel has a negligible effect on Jack Torrance in the filmed version . The cues Nicholson provides the audience as an actor merely hint at the potential for madness , which is only reinforced when we learn that the head of the family has struggled with alcoholism and is emotionally distant from his wife and son . The environment that he is in , however , then absorbs those personality defects and unleashes them upon his consciousness . In much the same way as buildings are sometimes thought to soak up events that happen there , the hotel feeds on the frailties of a troubled but sane man , and uses his weaknesses against him to eventually take him beyond the point of no return . He may have dormant flaws in his personality before he arrives , but to me the Overlook itself is the trigger that sets them off . Kubrick 's cold and detached approach to directing works splendidly for a chilly horror film , and the unpredictable force of nature that is Jack Nicholson teeters all the time between making you giggle and scaring the wits out of you . When he explodes , you wo n't be sure how far he can go . Together they made a great team and with a blend of their talents gave us a classic . If you want a great viewing experience , then this is an example that well and truly shines ...
Debut ? Wow -- Cross-Eyed is easily one of the most enjoyable indie films that I 've watched in the past year , making it hard to believe that Cross Eyed is the writer 's debut film . I mean -- I logged onto IMDb to find more films by this writer ... because Cross Eyed has that unique signature -- you want to see what else this writer might have to say . These days , its rare to see a movie that is well-written , well-directed , well-edited and well-acted . For me -- Cross Eyed encapsulates what movie making should be about -- combining the best of all film elements to create a clever , artistic and poignant tale . More , please .
Visconti 's first film has all his trademark visual flair and immaculate technique , accompanied by compelling performances from Massimo Girotti as the handsome drifter and , best of all , Clara Calamai as the fabulous , frantic Giovanna . Remade several times as 'The Postman Rings Twice ' but never bettered . Ca n't believe this was the man 's first film ! It shows the confidence of someone at the zenith of their career .
While this movie wo n't go down in the annals of great cinema , it is a fun way to spend an hour and a half with the family . The film is finally being released in video where it should have debuted in the first place . The film is about an eclectic group of friends who gather for dinners which they have named , `` The Hungry Bachelors Club '' . Jorja Fox plays a woman who serves as a surrogate in order to get a down payment for the restaurant that she wants to open . Bill Nunn plays a Cadillac-loving mystery man who becomes her lover . Fox gives an understated and touching performance and Nunn is reliably talented as always . Micheal des Barres is a hoot as an over the top attorney . The ensemble casts - made up of familiar faces - works nicely together to bring this wacky group of characters to life . This is a good rental and one of the few you can watch with the whole family .
Virile , but naive , big Joe Buck leaves his home in Big Spring , Texas , and hustles off to the Big Apple in search of women and big bucks . In NYC , JB meets up with frustration , and with `` Ratso '' Rizzo , a scruffy but cordial con artist . Somehow , this mismatched pair manage to survive each other which in turn helps both of them cope with a gritty , sometimes brutal , urban America , en route to a poignant ending . Both funny and depressing , our `` Midnight Cowboy '' rides head-on into the vortex of cyclonic cultural change , and thus confirms to 1969 viewers that they , themselves , have been swept away from the 1950 's age of innocence , and dropped , Dorothy and Toto like , into the 1960 's Age of Aquarius . The film 's direction is masterful ; the casting is perfect ; the acting is top notch ; the script is crisp and cogent ; the cinematography is engaging ; and the music enhances all of the above . Deservedly , it won the best picture Oscar of 1969 , and I would vote it as one of the best films of that cyclonic decade .
Canadian director Vincenzo Natali took the art-house circuit by storm with the intriguing and astonishingly intelligent Cube , which is my personal favourite SF film of the 90s . It framed the basic conceit of a group of strangers trapped in a maze shaped like a giant cube , shot entirely on one set , and took this idea in fascinating directions . I 've been eagerly awaiting Natali 's follow-up , and although its taken five years for him to mount another project , I 'm delighted to say it was worth the wait . Cypher is a fascinating exploration of one man 's place in the world , and how through a completely logical chain of events , finds himself in a situation beyond his control . I do n't want to reveal too much about the plot , because one of the joys of Cypher is the different avenues it takes us down . It is so refreshing in this day and age to see a SF film that has more than one idea in it 's head . Cypher is such a film . Morgan Sullivan ( Jeremy Northam ) , one of the blandest people to ever walk the planet , is hired by the company DigiCorp . They send him to different parts of America to record different seminars . To his bewilderment , they are unbelievably boring . Covering topics as mundane as shaving cream and cheese . While Morgan is waiting for one seminar , he runs into Rita Foster ( an impeccably cast Lucy Liu ) , the definition of an ice maiden . She gives him the brush-off , but there is something to her he finds irresistible . That 's not too surprising considering the dry marriage he is in . When Rita turns up at another one of Morgan 's seminars , she tells him his life is not what it appears . And I 'm not saying anything more about the plot . To do so would cheapen the impact the rest of the film has on us , as well as the tortuous path that 's so much fun to follow . As with Cube , Natali shows quite a talent for encompassing seemingly ordinary people , taking them out of the familiar , and basically seeing what will happen when they 're thrust into the unknown . And Cypher follows similar patterns . But it 's not a carbon copy of Cube . It has it 's own inspiration . Cypher is a film that has more in common with conspiracy thrillers and paranoia stories . One of the great things about Cypher is the way these themes creep into the story without your knowledge . When Morgan realises his false identity is a piece of a much larger puzzle , it 's as much of a shock to us as it is to him . One thing that distinguishes Cypher from Cube is how much more polished it is . Where Cube was confined to a minimalist setting and a shoestring budget with a cast of unknowns , Cypher is also on a low budget , but Natali economises it as much as he can , allowing him to broaden the horizon , and launching Morgan on an amazing journey through the labyrinth of his own identity . Natali 's direction is exceptional , with a deft hand on the reins . There are some amazing camera angles from above , such as the enormity of the DigiCorp building as a vast , robust office block in conjunction to the insignificant speck that is Morgan standing outside . All the colour appears to have been bled out of the picture , which compliments the tone of the film perfectly as a modern day film-noir . The acting is uniformly excellent throughout . Jeremy Northam is a sympathetic figure from his loveless marriage to questioning his own identity . His performance is excellent because it 's so modulated . He literally seems to transform right before our very eyes . From a clinical , spineless wimp to a confident man who will do anything to preserve his new identity . David Hewlett puts in a welcome appearance who made such an impact in Cube . He resides in a secret silo that looks like it was borrowed from Men in Black . His scene is one of the best because it 's an exercise in carefully calculated suspense and paranoia . He is a supposed expert in identifying double-agents , and it 's a fantastic piece of writing , brilliantly acted by Hewlett . All he has to do is look at Morgan , and we 're drawn into his complex mind game . But it 's Lucy Liu who 's the scene stealer here . Too often she is cast in films where her potential is not utilised to full effect . But in Cypher , she is finally given a character that fits her like a glove . Rita is an aloof , guarded femme fatale that Liu inhabits with relish . I perked up every time she appeared because she is always in control , and can reduce a room to silence by the power of her icy stare alone . Things come to a very gratifying end , that does n't conclude on an ambiguous note the way Cube did . But Morgan deserves his happy ending . After he 's been put through the ringer like this , I cheered for him in the final scene . It 's a perfect final moment because it comes as a ray of sunshine after a gloomy 90 minutes . Cypher succeeds on all counts . Engaging , shocking , always entertaining , it 's everything that Total Recall wanted to be but was n't . And it comes as a refreshing antidote to the overwhelming and inexplicable Matrix . A fine follow-up from Natali . And now I 'm a committed fan of the man . Superb stuff !
Once you pick your jaw up from off the floor from the realization that they ... somehow ... managed to put this thing together so fast that it was released the same year the case ended , you 'll find that it 's not half bad . The plot is engaging and interesting , and the pacing is fast , with this covering many situations , and thus often jumping swiftly on to the next one after a line or two has been spoken . Where this really stands out is the acting . The performances are excellent . Neill and Streep are both impeccable . It 's also cool to hear so much Australian spoken in a Hollywood film , and even those who do n't come naturally to it at least attempt an accent . The cinematography and editing are nice enough , but they do n't really go beyond the standard stuff . This movie 's story is compelling and the fact that it is authentic just makes it all the more chilling . While I have not read the novel or heard of what happened outside of this picture , I understand that it is quite close to the truth . There is some moderate to strong language and disturbing content in this . It is , at times , a downright great courtroom drama . I recommend this to any fellow fan of such . 7/10
I saw True Crime when it was first released back in the mid-nineties and I have watched it many times since . It is a great mystery about Mary ( played by Alicia Silverstone ) , a high school senior in a California town who 's classmate 's younger sister was tortured and killed by an unknown murderer . Mary meets Tony ( played by Kevin Dillon ) , a police cadet who sees how bright she is and they decide to work together to try to find the killer . Many suspects in this one . True Crime feels very `` true '' or real to me . I read a newsgroup review where someone wrote that total suspension of disbelief is present here and it is so true . Alicia Silverstone is perfect in this role and Kevin Dillon and Bill Nunn do a great job , as do the other actors . The locations are right on and the writer/director , Pat Verducci , really captures some of the realities of teenage life and of Mary 's loneliness ( see the scene where Mary awakens from the dream sequence after having viewed the photos she took of Tony ) . I wish Verducci would make more movies . I have not seen any other movie quite like True Crime . 10/10
I first saw Rob Roy twelve years ago . With little money for entertainment , I rented it for my fiancé and I to watch on a bone chilling winter 's night . The movie I had wanted was gone , so I rented this instead , not expecting much , and was very much surprised with how good it was . I just recently watched it again , and loved it every bit as much as the first time . For those unfamiliar with the story , it 's about Scottish outlaw Robert Roy MacGregor , a cattleman and folk hero . From the little I know about the man and his story , liberties have been taken with the facts , but it 's a movie , not a textbook , and so the filmmakers can be excused . Basically , the plot of the movie is that Rob Roy borrows money from the Marquis of Montrose to buy cattle which he then intends to sell and reap a large profit from . But , his plan is foiled when the friend entrusted with the money is robbed of the cash and murdered in the forest . Our hero finds himself on the run after failing to settle the matter with the Marquis , and Mary , his wife , suffers a sadistic rape at the hands of Archibald Cunningham , a smarmy Englishman with no soul . Atrocities ensue , until , in an immensely satisfying conclusion , Rob carves Archibald up like a Christmas turkey . There are many great performances in this movie , but allow me to touch specifically on a few . Liam Neeson , as usual , is fantastic , a sexy beast you ca n't take your eyes off of . Honestly , this man is like ice cream : even when he 's bad he 's good . His Rob Roy is an honourable man struggling to provide for those who depend on him , in the best way he knows how . Jessica Lange , as Mary , gives this woman a fierceness which is a nice change from the simpering , dull movie wives audiences are usually forced to endure . You just know she does n't take any b.s from Rob , or anyone else for that matter . Tim Roth is completely over the top with his portrayal of the evil Archibald , yet somehow , it works . All the posturing and preening , combined with some wicked dialogue , result in one of the most memorable movie villains in recent memory . Combine all of this , and the stellar work by other supporting players , with the luscious scenery of Scotland , and you have what amounts to one really , really cool movie . If you have n't seen this , I highly recommend that you do .
I did n't know what to make of this film . I guess that is what it was all about really . I have never seen a film like it and I doubt that I really ever will again . Glover puts together something that is unique to him . I think to appreciate it you have to read some of his poetry , maybe see one of his slide shows . I really like this guy , he is just so bizarre I ca n't help it . Note : I saw this film before it was through its final editing , so maybe what I have seen and what others have seen are different . I will know , I guess , if I choose to view the film again . I think I will have to be properly drug influenced ...
Mel Gibson 's Braveheart was a spectacularly accomplished film , but it left a sour taste in the mouth . Rob Roy , by contrast , is slightly less polished , but a better film by far . This is a historical film which combines timeless themes with truly historical values , whereas Braveheart put a gross and unpleasant comtemporary gloss on an ancient tale . What makes this film is the cast . Liam Neeson plays the hero , in a role he basically reprised ( in a watered-down fashion ) in the Phantom Menace . The character is heroic , but is neither the greatest fighter nor the most demonic lover . Admirable yet human , he commands the screen . Against him are set a selection of equally human adversaries including Tim Roth 's Cunningham , obnoxious but brilliant , and John Hurt 's morally bankrupt laird . Also to praise is Jessica Lange , as Rob 's pragmatic wife : also strong and noble , but 300 years away from a modern heroine , which is only as it should be . This is not the most original film you will see , but it has the courage of its own convictions , and the strong performances make you care .
( Sorry for my faulty language , i am no native speaker ... ) Yes , this is a movie that almost demands an overwhelming reaction . Personally i agree upon all those superlatives that are around . But i wo n't use this rather sematically void way myself to describe the movie here . Because those `` perfect ! the one-and-only ! best-ever ! `` -reviews make some people turn away ( including me ) . So if you are looking for another 'Hamlet ' that has the potential to rival with many theatrical and all cinematic ones - Then do n't miss this one , if you happen to find it anywhere . ( Unfortunately not too many people will have any chance to see it . It seems there is no DVD out there , and the German language version - which is quite well done - is not available in any format . ) Just in case you decide to get a copy : Spare out that cut down two hours ( or so ) version of this movie . It is no use and no fun , and gives a wrong impression of a movie , that deals in an interesting way with flow and architecture . And its also crippled down to 4:3 aspect ratio . Greetings from Germany , F.L .
Always fancied this film from the video cover . Eventually got round to buying it for a fiver in a sale and boy what a film . A simply stunning performance from all of the case and it 's filmed so beautifully . Even at times from a distance so you can barely hear what the dialogue is , as if you really are that distance away picking up bits of the tale . It 's really moving , frequently amusing and very watchable . Not much dialogue but is filmed in such a way that you feel so much throuout . A 9/10 from me . A must see .
Beautiful and touching movie . Rich colors , great settings , good acting and one of the most charming movies I have seen in a while . I never saw such an interesting setting when I was in China . My wife liked it so much she asked me to log on and rate it so other would enjoy too .
Sandwiched in between San Francisco and Captains Courageous two of Spencer Tracy 's greatest parts is this very curious film about war and the effects it has on some people . They Gave Him A Gun stars Spencer Tracy and Franchot Tone in the only film they ever made together and Gladys George as the woman who loves them both . Tracy and Tone are a couple of World War I draftees , Tone is a weak character who almost goes over the hill in boot camp , but Tracy stops him . Tracy is still playing the lovable blowhard , younger Wallace Beery type that MGM envisioned for him when they signed him away from Fox . Over at the front Tone gets an opportunity and takes it when during a fight he manages to get to a church tower that peers down on a German machine gun nest . He 's learned to shoot by now and he does a Sergeant York . But Alvin C. York was never changed by the war the way Tone has . Wounded in the fight Tone convalesces at a hospital with Gladys George looking out for him . Tracy goes AWOL himself to visit his pal and he and George get something going . Later on when Tracy is reported missing in action , Tone and George marry . Tracy 's brokenhearted when he comes back and learns of the marriage , but takes sit in stride . The rest of the film is dealing with Tone applying the the wartime skills he 's learned to the gangster trade . He 's a hit-man now and George does n't really know what he does for a living . I think you can figure the rest out . The part of the film that gave me some trouble is that I ca n't believe Gladys George could n't figure it out . She 's a street smart girl , her part is very much like the one she played in The Roaring Twenties opposite James Cagney . Speaking of The Roaring Twenties , Humphrey Bogart 's character development there is similar to Tone 's although he was not the central character of the movie . In fact there are elements of They Gave Him A Gun that are to be found in Taxi Driver and in Clint Eastwood 's classic , The Unforgiven . The World War I battle sequences are very well staged by director Woody Van Dyke . For some reason Leonard Maltin panned this film , I think it 's a lot better than he gave it credit .
A really sweet movie that has some similarities to the 2001-hit `` My Sassy Girl '' but is able to enchant most of the time . The biggest applause should go to the two leads . Ha-Neul Kim is both sweet and quirky , Sang-woo Kwon is both attractive and rebellious . The chemistry between the two is very good . Director Kyeong-hyeong Kim uses some CG-inserts to pepper up the visuals and also offers impressive fight scenes in which Sang-woo Kwon can shine . I liked him a lot better here than in the highly overrated `` Volcano High '' . And that boy has a future - those looks , those fight techniques , and a romantic lead . Not bad . Well , I can make it short : Nice film . My rating : 7/10
This film is mesmerizing in its beauty and creativity . An artist 's profound vision , his art that springs intuitively from its natural source brings us an inspiring Hosanna , blending his creations with trees , white water dashing against rocks , fields and rain ... Andy Goldsworthy makes the viewer feel joy in being alive , aware that we are all made of the clay of this glorious earth . He does n't spare us his occasional frustration , but on the whole we see the miracle in joining art with nature . Credit also goes of course to the filmmaker , Thomas Riedelsheimer , who directed , photographed and edited the movie with incredible sensibility and perfect timing . If you have any feeling for beauty , nature and art ... do not miss this fantastic film !
I just picked up the DVD release of this movie while on holiday in Norway where it has been released with English subtitles . The film is beautifully photographed and powerfully acted . The youngster portraying 'Frits ' the lead character has an astonishingly open face which mirrors with painful accuracy the tragic events which unfold around him . Early on in the film we see that the father whom Frits loves so much has mental health problems and this is brought up when the brutal headmaster denies assaulting the boy and suggests it was his own father . The climactic scene where Frits refuses to show any respect to the headmaster ; simply standing his ground and repeating 'Liar ' as he is brutally assaulted in front of his classmates is a scene you are not likely to forget . The films only weak point is the rather clichéd 'Flower Power ' teacher who uses every 'friendly teacher ' trick in the book . Other than this I feel sure that this is a film you will really enjoy .
Titanic is a long but well made tragic adventure love story that takes place during the ill-fated voyage on the unsinkable ship . Writer/Director James Cameron has done a great job of making this movie about a fictional love story between two very different people and combining that with the real event of the Titanic that sunk after hitting an iceberg on April 15 , 1912 claiming thousands of lives who perished in the icy freeing waters of the North Atlantic . The two leads in the film are great in their roles including Leonardo DiCaprio and Kate Winslet . They make for a good on-screen couple . DiCpario and Winslet also had genuine chemistry together which made the romance that eventually blossoms between them that much more believable . They both showed real talent when this one came out and both of them have continued to show just that in their most recently films as well . The rest of the supporting cast including Billy Zane , Kathy Bates , Frances Fisher , Jonathan Hyde , and Bill Paxton in a small role are equally impressive as their characters who help bring them to life in this film . The love story , the action , suspense , and the special effects are magnificent done especially for that time . The horror of the situation the characters were in felt so real because it really happened making you want most of them to survive this life and death situation . The pacing was a little slow at times and it was a little long but the rest of the movie made up for it 's few flaws . Titanic makes for a great date movie which is sure to make some girls cry almost every time they watch it . The fact that this really happened definitely added to the movie making you feel sorry for all the lives lost when the Titanic sunk into the Atlantic after hitting an iceberg . Overall Titanic is a tragic heartbreaking story about two people who fall in love while on the ill-fated ship thats brought to life by the exceptional performances from the cast especially DiCaprio and Winslet who definitely make this movie worth the time to watch .
This is quite the gripping , fascinating , tragic story . Quite good , and for the most part pretty accurate , considering it IS a TV movie rather than a documentary . They did create some fictional characters , and combine several actual people into one character , but otherwise this is a good telling of a very tragic and dark story . The final moments of the movie , depicting the mass suicide/murder , are almost directly taken from an audio recording made by Jim Jones . This recording was made during the final 44 minutes of the Peoples Temple 's existence . It is available in several places on the internet . This portion of the film is almost spot on in that regard . To sum up , a documentary this is not . However , it does cover most of the base elements to the People 's Temple story .
I enjoyed this show for two reasons 1 . Richard Dean Anderson 2 . Amanda Tapping . These two performers carried the show with able support from the regulars and recurring actors . The replacement of RDA in seasons 9-10 was enough to take the heart out of the show . The chemistry between all the main characters is just tremendous . You get the feeling that the actors like to pal around after the camera stops rolling . This relationship carries over into the program we get to see . RDA gives his 'O'Neill ' character believable personality . He never knows when to give the wiseass in him a rest . You watch the others roll their eyes in dismay at some of his utterances . Still , they know that he is the man to have around when the situation is perilous . There is a lot going on between 'Carter ' and 'O'Neill ' under the surface . They manage to keep the lid on , but often just barely . The episode 'Solitudes ' in season 1 had some of the best drama ever seen on television . The love between the two made the prospect of dying bearable because they faced it together . 'Carter ' and 'Jackson ' often have to smooth over some of the turbulence created by 'O'Neill ' . Yet 'O'Neill 's ' tactical instincts always seem sound . He understands what to do without having to think about the matter . The team has several times been placed in jeopardy by the others not listening to his orders . The quality declined markedly in seasons 9 and 10 . The original story arc was mostly used up and the new villains never really caught my interest . Ben Browder was far inferior to RDA in carrying the show . He had his rare moments with Claudia Black , but that was all . Amanda Tapping was phoning in her performances these two seasons . You could see her greatly changed appearance after having a baby . She was probably thinking more about the child than the show . The spin-off 'Stargate Atlantis ' has a few moments , but is mostly a weaker effort . The major characters lack the chemistry of the cast of the original . The villains ( Wraiths ) are so improbable as to be ludicrous . Maybe Amanda Tapping can breathe some life into the program or it wo n't last beyond the fourth season . There has always been a problem for me in the special effects for the show . To have spaceships shaped as pyramids is a design monstrosity seldom equaled in Sci-Fi . The use of torches for illumination in these ships is just as bad . The campy use of decor from ancient Egypt concealing ultra-modern technology is just as hard to accept . I wondered about some of the continuity on the show too . In the season 2 opener , 'Daniel Jackson ' is shot up and his uniform has a gaping hole where he was wounded . He crawls into a sarcophagus and it heals his body and restores his uniform like it just came off the rack in the wardrobe closet . The episode 'Hathor ' has a sarcophagus fall into the hands of the SGC , yet it is never mentioned again . This device could have been used in several later episodes on 'Daniel ' , 'O'Neill ' , and 'Dr . Frasier ' .
I really truly enjoyed this movie . ( Which is why it surprised me that it got such a low rating from so many users at this site ! ) I am not saying that it is a cinematic masterpiece but it was a great way to spend a cold , snowy Saturday night . It is funny , poignant , and a great tales of the ups and downs of female friendships lasting through difficult times and the bad things that female friends tend to do to each others ! ( fess up ladies , we have ALL BEEN THERE ! ) Bill Paterson shines as the Reverand Gerald Marsden and Andie McDowell proves that she can be a fine actress when the role is right and she puts her mind to it . ( And truly , there is the best `` wedding escape '' that I have ever seen or dreamed up in this film ... more guts than anyone I have ever known ! ) You will laugh and you will cry -- - ignore any marketing campaigns and how this film is being marketing ... . it is a hidden gem that should have done TONNES of box office . ( now I have to look around to purchase a copy ! )
If ever there were an inspiring story that could move anyone , disabled or not , to persevere despite the odds and make it ( even when `` make it '' as an expression , proper , can have a wide berth which is an ultimately personal truth ) , MY LEFT FOOT is it . It 's a hard film to watch at times : seeing the less placid aspects of Christy Brown 's personality emerge in two key scenes -- one when his sister declares she is pregnant and about to get married while his father has a bad reaction , and at a dinner table when the woman who 's reached out to him , made him able to communicate effectively , now has announced at a key moment ( the inauguration of Brown 's art ) she is about to marry another man -- is tough . Very , very tough . More so because this is a man who can not react accordingly to these events and can only express himself in the only way he knows how : via screams , shrieks , and profanities aimed at hurting himself . However , this is not a story of heartache and family dysfunction even when there is quite a bit of it furnishing the autobiographical account , but that of a man overcoming his severe disability , becoming a functioning human being and a force of be reckoned with in the art world . Daniel Day Lewis won an Oscar for his powerful , unforgettable performance as the flawed but tenacious Christy Brown , and Brenda Fricker did so as well for her supporting role as Brown 's solid mother .
Conrad Hall went out with a bang . The great film photographer finished his illustrious career with this movie before passing on . He did himself proud as this is one of the best-looking crime films you 'll ever see . Of course , the acting ai n't bad when you have Tom Hanks and Paul Newman playing the leads ! The amount of action in here is just right , too : not too much ; not too little . None of the characters in here , frankly , are `` good guys '' as Hanks is a professional hit-man for town boss Newman . Hanks ' only redeeming quality is not wanting his young son to wind up a killer like him , although he does teach him how to be the getaway man in robberies ! Huh ? As good as the acting is and as interesting as the story is , the real star of this film is cinematographer Hall , who paints scene after beautiful scene with his lens . His work is just awesome .
Excellent movie , a realistic picture of contemporary Finland , touching and profound . One of the best Finnish films ever made . Captures marvelously the everyday life in a Central Finland small town , people 's desires and weaknesses , joys and sorrows . The bright early fall sunshine creates a cool atmosphere to this lucid examination of people in a welfare society . Lampela is indeed one of the most promising Finnish filmmakers . He shows that it is possible to make gripping movies without machine guns and bloodshed . His next film Eila is also worth seeing although the story of cleaning women fighting for their jobs is not quite as universally appealing as the destinies in Joki .
This is a pretty strange movie . It does comes across as an exploitation film with over-the-top violence and unrealistic situations , but unusual for being constructed around rural characters at war with each other , as opposed to an invading 'other ' . The movie is an excessive stereotype of Vietnam veterans , in a long line of films that portrayed the vets of that war as dangerous psycopaths . Kris Kristofferson 's last line is 'I ai n't lost a war yet ' , as he meets his demise after wreaking a long trail of murder and destruction , including the town 's chief of police and his brother 's girlfriend in a particularly chilling scene . However , Kristofferson is a good enough actor , and charismatic enough , to carry this villain with a surprising depth . Vincent is clearly the golden boy , but with enough intensity layered over his clean cut goodness . The movie bears some plot resemblance to Winchester 73 where Jimmy Stewart tries to tolerate a criminal brother until being forced to act against him . The movie has b-movie grade action , though the presence of Kristofferson , Vincent , a gorgeous Victoria Principal and Bernadette Peters give it an A-grade lineup . I give it a 7 for being a long lost view into an American psyche of post-Vietnam/pre-Reagan introspection , paranoia , and confusion , and a movie industry that was willing to address such topics at that time . Seen on the THIS channel , a great network that keeps playing lots of old movies of the 70s through 90s , regardless of political bent .
I 'm 60 years old , a guitarist , ( lead/rhythm ) , and over the last forty years , I 've been in four bands , it 's all there , the fights , the foul-ups , the rotten food , the worse accommodation , always travelling , little or no money , and every one was drunk or high . But , the clubs , the fans , and the music , made it all worth it ! Just like Strange Fruit ! I 'm too damn old for it now , and the arthritis in the hands and hips mean no more rocking , but for the length of that video , it all came back , and it was all there ! The birds , the brawls , and the booze ! And I was young again ! It 's just like Billy Connolly 's voice over , God likes that 70 's stuff ! Rock On Forever !
Talk about a dream cast - just two of the most wonderful actors who ever appeared anywhere - Peter Ustinov and Maggie Smith - together - in `` Hot Millions , '' a funny , quirky comedy also starring Karl Malden , Robert Morley , and Bob Newhart . Ustinov is an ex-con embezzler who gets the resume of a talented computer programmer ( Morley ) and takes a position in a firm run by Malden - with the goal of embezzlement in mind . It 's not smooth sailing ; he has attracted the attention of his competitor at the company , played by Newhart , and his neighbor , Maggie Smith ( who knows him at their place of residence under another name ) , becomes his secretary for a brief period . She ca n't keep a job and she is seen throughout the film in a variety of employment - all ending with her being fired . When Newhart makes advances to her , she invites Ustinov over to her flat for curry as a cover-up , but the two soon decide they 're made for each other . Of course , she does n't know Ustinov is a crook . This is such a good movie - you ca n't help but love Ustinov and Smith and be fascinated by Ustinov 's machinations , his genius , and the ways he slithers out of trouble . But there 's a twist ending that will show you who really has the brains . Do n't miss this movie , set in '60s London . It 's worth if it only to hear Maggie Smith whine , `` I 've been sacked . ''
really excellent movie , one of the best i 've seen . Touching and simple - just like life , sometimes you cry sometimes you laugh and it 's just beautiful . not too much of anything , just as it 's suppose to be . Really loved the idea of the movie , noone is bad or good , all or just people , sometimes make mistakes mostly because of society 's pressure , everyone tries to stay strong and some succeed more than others and the most important thing is that you do n't have reasons to get angry - you can do it , but eventually the anger goes away and then you to need to let love come back in although it 's hard , there lies the true happiness . Great actors and cast , the movie really gets you into the feeling of the movie . nice nice nice . I recommend to see it , especially if you like to see italians ' life ...
'The second beginning ' as it 's title explains , shows us the beginning of the end for the human race . Set long before the matrix existed , this short anime written by the Wachowski 's shows us the world that could lay infront of us in the not to distant future , set at the turn of the 21st century , the second renaissance delves into issues common with human behaviour ; greed , power , control , vanity etc . The use of robots or artificial intellegence as slaves or servents is common among science fiction/fantasy stories . The second renaissance is no exeption to this concept , however instead of a simple man vs. machine layout , this story explains the struggle that the machines put up with , the struggle for acceptance in a world ruled by humans . Where the matrix films show us the human perspective , these short animations tell both sides of the story . The second renaissance part 1 + 2 , answer many questions brought up by the original Matrix film , such as how the war broke out , how the sky was blackend , what led to the use of humans as batteries and it also introduces us to the machine city called 01 , which may have relevance to the upcoming Matrix Revolutions film . I wo n't give away too much of the story , as I do not want to ruin the experience for perspective viewers , however , I will recommend it to anybody interested in the world of the matrix or simply anybody interested in Japanese animation ( anime ) . 9/10 .
While in the barn of Kent Farm with Shelby waiting for Chloe , Clark is attacked and awakes in a mental institution in the middle of a session with Dr. Hudson . The psychologist tells him that for five years he has been delusional , believing that he has come from Krypton and had superpowers . Clark succeeds to escape , and meets Lana , Martha and Lex that confirm the words of Dr. Hudson . Only Chloe believe on his words , but she is also considered insane . Clark fights to find the truth about his own personality and origin . `` Labyrinth '' is undoubtedly the most intriguing episode of `` Smallville '' . The writer was very luck and original denying the whole existence of the powerful boy from Krypton . The annoying hum gives the sensation of disturbance and the identity mysterious saver need to be clarified . My vote is nine . Title ( Brazil ) : `` Labirinto '' ( `` Labyrinth '' )
I saw this movie at the 18th Haifa film festival , and it is one of the best I 've seen this year . Seeing it on a big screen ( and I mean BIG , not one of those TV screens most cinemas have ) with an excellent sound system always enhance the cinematic experience , as the movie takes over your eyes and ears and sucks you into the story , into the picture . The movie presents a set of characters , which are loosely inter-connected . Their stories cross at certain points , and the multiplicity of story lines reminded me very much of the great Robert Altman and his exquisite films . But the true hero of the movie is obviously the city of Madrid , which provides the backdrop for the entire movie . It houses the characters , contains the pavements and roads on which they walk , and sets the background atmosphere for all the events , all in beautifully filmed scenes . The movie returns again and again to certain themes ( shoes , for instance ) , and in essence Salazar makes his metaphores more and more understandable to the viewer as the movie progresses . He combines the views of the city with the shots of the characters , and elegantly matches the feeling of the scene to the background . A set of talented actors helps him portrait a wide variety of characters . One excellent example is the scene in which Juaquin takes Anita across the street for the first time . It might not work on a small screen , but it gave me goose bumps easily on a big screen . The message of the movie is very positive , and accordingly the movie is light and funny at times . The music along the movie is usually pop , with a few instrumental pieces ( I hope to put my hand on the soundtrack one day , although I seriously doubt I will ) . All together , I came out of this movie with a sensational feeling , and I 'm not easily impressed ( you 'll have to take my word for it ) . For this and more I give this movie a solid 8/10 .
I read thru most of the comments posted here & all I can say it that most of these posters have major problems in life . This show , unlike most game show , was fun . Mr. Shatner , whose brill in ALL that he does , was again the hit of the show . He 's genuinely bubbly personality shines like a beacon where ever he goes . He 's fun & makes you smile & that 's exactly what the show does also . The dancers & questions , the round-about fashion they 're presented only add to the shows appeal . And even though there 's a Great deal of money at stake it 's fun . The pressure ( stress ) that exists in most game shows does NOT exist here . Several people who posted messages complained how much time is waisted with the dancers & choosing questions , & c , like Millionaire does n't have similar time wasters . All I can say is most of you have missed the whole concept . The idea here is to have FUN & ENJOY yourself . There 's something for everyone . Qustions to test your knowledge , eye candy ( the dancers ) , suspense , Mr. Shatner 's wonderful fun-filled personality ... well if that does n't perk-up guys up then I feel bad for you ; and if that 's not enough , YOU CAN GET RICH ! I really miss the show . Out of ALL the games shows that have ever been on , & to be quite frank , I HATE game shows , this is the one I really liked & truly miss . The only other game show I ever liked was Match Game .
Today 's sci-fi thrillers are more like Rambo in outer-space with monster special effects ( frequently ludicrous such as sounds of explosions in the vacuum of space ) . Though tame by today 's standards , the special effects of `` Forbidden Planet '' were quite striking for their time . Even today , they still hold plausibility . Yet , the best part of the movie is perhaps the reason that radio thrillers still have appeal . Much of what was going on was left up to the imaginations of the audience . ( What did the Krell creatures look like ? ) By having much of the framework of the story never divulged or only divulged in the end , the tension and suspense held throughout the movie . The ending was also very thought-provoking and satisfying . In my mind , this is still one of the best ( if not the best ) sci-fi films ever made .
Bored and unhappy young babe Zandalee ( a winningly sultry and vibrant performance by luscious brunette knockout Erika Anderson ) feels trapped in a stale and loveless marriage to failed poet and decent , yet dull businessman Thierry Martin ( a solid and credible portrayal by Judge Reinhold ) . Zandalee has a torrid adulterous fling with sleazy and arrogant artist Johnny Collins ( deliciously played to the slimy hilt by Nicolas Cage ) . Can the relationship between Thierry and Zandalee be salvaged ? Or is everything going to fall apart and go to seed ? Director Sam Pillsbury and screenwriter Mari Kornhauser lay on the tawdry soap opera-style histrionics something thick while attempting to tell a wannabe serious and insightful story about desire run amok and its potentially dangerous consequences ; the plot goes gloriously off the rails in the laughably histrionic last third . The dialogue is likewise hilariously silly and vulgar ( sample line : `` I wan na shake you naked and eat you alive '' ) . Better still , this flick certainly delivers plenty of tasty female nudity ( the gorgeously statuesque Anderson looks smoking hot in the buff ) and sizzling semi-pornographic soft-core sex scenes ( Johnny and Zandalee doing the dirty deed in a church confessional booth rates as a definite steamy highlight ) . The tart'n'tangy New Orleans setting adds extra spice to the already steamy proceedings . With his long , scruffy black hair , greasy mustache , foul mouth , and coarse manners , Cage 's Johnny is an absolute hoot as the single most grossly unappealing `` romantic '' lead to ever ooze his way onto celluloid . The cast deserve props for acting with admirable sincerity : Anderson , Cage and Reinhold all do respectable work with their parts , with fine support from Joe Pantoliano as Zandalee 's merry flamboyant homosexual friend Gerri , Viveca Lindfors as Theirry 's wise , perceptive mother Tatta , Aaron Neville as friendly bartender Jack , and Steve Buscemi as a funny , blithely shameless thief . Walt Lloyd 's sharp and gleaming cinematography gives the picture an attractive glossy look . The flavorsome , harmonic score by Pray for Rain likewise hits the spot . A delightfully campy and seamy riot .
`` Crush '' examines female friendship , for the most part avoiding the saccharine quality which spoils so many films with the same theme ( e. g. , `` Steel Magnolias '' ) . At the same time , it reveals the power of a sudden passion to overwhelm and surprise . The events depicted were highly improbable , but the underlying emotional truth seemed very genuine to me . Not a film for the speeding-vehicle-and-explosion crowd , but grown-up women are certain to respond with both laughter and tears .
Yes , this production is long ( good news for Bronte fans ! ) and it has a somewhat dated feel , but both the casting and acting are so brilliant that you wo n't want to watch any other versions ! Timothy Dalton IS Edward Rochester ... it 's that simple . I do n't care that other reviewers claim he 's too handsome . Dalton is attractive , certainly , but no pretty-boy . In fact he possesses a craggy , angular dark charm that , in my mind , is quite in keeping with the mysterious , very masculine Mr R. And he takes on Rochester 's sad , tortured persona so poignantly . He portrays ferocity when the scene calls for it , but also displays Rochester 's tender , passionate , emotional side as well . ( IMO the newer A & E production suffers in that Ciaran Hinds - whom I normally adore - seems to bluster and bully his way throughout . I 've read the book many times and I never felt that Rochester was meant to be perceived as a nonstop snarling beast . ) When I reread the novel , I always see Zelah Clarke as Jane . Ms. Clarke , to me , resembles Jane as she describes herself ( and is described by others ) . Small , childlike , fairy ... though it 's true the actress does n't look 18 , she portrays Jane 's attributes so well . While other reviews have claimed that her acting is wooden or unemotional , one must remember that the character spent 8 years at Lowood being trained to hold her emotions and `` passionate nature '' in check . Her main inspiration was her childhood friend Helen , who was the picture of demure submission . Although her true nature was dissimilar , Jane learned to master her temper and appear docile , in keeping with the school 's aims for its charity students who would go into 'service ' . Jane becomes a governess in the household of the rich Mr. Rochester . She would certainly *not* speak to him as an equal . Even later on when she gave as well as she got , she would always be sure to remember that her station was well below that of her employer . Nevertheless , if you read the book - to which this production stays amazingly close - you can clearly see the small struggles Zelah-as-Jane endures as she subdues her emotions in order to remain mild and even-tempered . The chemistry between Dalton and Clarke is just right , I think . No , it does not in the least resemble Hollywood ( thank God ! It 's not a Hollywood sort of book ) but theirs is a romance which is true , devoted and loyal . And for a woman like Jane , who never presumed to have *any* love come her way , it is a minor miracle . The rest of the casting is terrific , and I love the fact that nearly every character from the book is present here . So , too , is much of the rich , poetic original dialogue . This version is the only one that I know of to include the lovely , infamous 'gypsy scene ' and in general , features more humor than other versions I 've seen . In particular , the mutual teasing between the lead characters comes straight from the book and is so delightful ! Jane Eyre was , in many ways , one of the first novelized feminists . She finally accepted love on her own terms and independently , and , at last , as Rochester 's true equal . Just beautiful !
Saw this movie at the Rotterdam IFF . You may question some decisions of the maker - like choosing a mockumentary form for such a sensitive and horrible subject - but this movie sure hits you in the gut . Especially the last scenes were almost painful to watch . Hope it gets the distribution it deserves .
There are some films that every Horror fan owes himself ( or herself ) to see , and Emilio Miraglia 's `` La Dama Rossa Uccide Sette Volte '' aka . `` The Red Queen Kills Seven Times '' ( 1972 ) is definitely one of them . With Gialli and Gothic Tales being my two favorite sub-genres in Horror , I was looking forward to seeing this film for quite a while , and even though my expectations were high , this masterpiece surpassed my greatest hopes . Miraglia 's earlier Giallo , `` The Night Evelyn Came Out of the Grave '' ( 1971 ) was already a creepy and highly atmospheric film which successfully mixed Giallo with Gothic Horror , but it could n't possibly compare to this instant personal favorite . `` The Red Queen Kills Seven Times '' is , hands down , one of the most unique and overwhelming Italian Horror films ever made , and no lover of the genre could possibly consider missing it . An incredibly mesmerizing Giallo with strong Gothic elements , `` The Red Queen '' delivers everything one could hope for in either sub-genre : An inventive and incredibly compelling plot , spine-chilling suspense , a sublimely uncanny setting and a genuinely creepy atmosphere , eerily lush colors , stylish murders , a brilliant score , and , not least , a ravishing female cast lead by the stunningly beautiful Barbara Bouchet - this film simply is one of the most outstanding combinations of elegant beauty and pure terror . The film starts out incredibly in a beautiful Gothic castle in Germany . As little girls , Kitty Wildenbrück and her sister Evelyn have been fighting when their grandfather tells them the story behind an incredibly uncanny painting : Legend has it that a fiendish Red Lady is to return to the castle every hundred years and kill seven people . Fourteen years later , Kitty ( Barbara Bouchet ) has become a successful fashion photographer . Suddenly , people begin to get murdered ... Director Miraglia had already proved his incredible talent for style , atmosphere and colorful creepiness with `` The Night Evelyn Came Out of the Grave '' and he makes use of these elements even far more effectively in this gem . `` The Red Queen Kills Seven Times '' is a feast for the eyes indeed , and one of the most overwhelming Italian Horror films both visually and plot-wise . The haunting painting in the Grandfather 's castle alone is capable of giving the viewer the goosebumps . The Red Lady ( or Red Queen , as she is called in the English title ) is arguably the most fiendish figure ever in a Giallo , the spine-chilling laughter that the murders are accompanied by would even be frightening on its own . A sexy female cast is always appreciated , especially in a Giallo , and this one is a prime example for that . The ravishing Barbara Bouchet ( one of my favorite actresses ) must be one of the most stunningly beautiful ladies ever to appear on screen , and she is a great actress too . Bouchet 's presence has graded up many Italian flicks , among other appearances she starred in three of the greatest Cult-masterpieces of Italian 70s cinema within one year ( 1972 ) : Fernando Di Leo 's `` Milano Calibro 9 '' , Lucio Fulci 's Giallo-highlight `` Do n't Torture a Duckling '' and this unforgettable gem . Apart from the wonderful Miss Bouchet , the film 's gorgeous female cast includes sexy young Sybil Danning , Marina Malfatti ( `` The Night Evelyn Came Out of the Grave '' ) , and other beauties who are not afraid to bare it for the camera . As the whole film , the murders are stylish and extremely elegant , yet frightening and macabre , and some of them are quite gory . Bruno Nicolai 's mesmerizing score is as memorable as it gets , and makes the film 's intensely eerie atmosphere even more haunting . The plot is ingeniously convoluted and full of red herrings , the tension-level increses with each passing minute . `` The Red Queen ... '' begins creepy and it stays stunning to the last second . Overall , this is one of the films that I can not find enough words of praise for . `` The Red Queen Kills Seven Times '' is an absolute masterpiece that easily ranks among the finest Gialli ever made , and a top-priority for every fan of Horror and/or Italian cinema to see . 10/10
If you are a fan of Zorro , Indiana Jones , or action in general this is a must-see . Directed by Republic 's ace team of William Witney and John English , and starring Reed Hadley as Don Diego/Zorro , this serial delivers ! I wo n't bore you with the plot ( who cares ? less talking , more fighting ) ; what really matters here is Hadley 's superb interpretation of the character/s and the stunt work of Dale van Sickel and Yakima Canutt . ***STUNT SPOILERS FOLLOW *** You can see the influence this film had on Lucas and Spielberg -- Zorro gets caught in the original version of the Star Wars trash compactor in one chapter , trapped on a rope bridge a'la Temple of Doom in another , does a Raiders horse-to-coach transfer and even flees through a tunnel while the baddies knock over a huge water tank and flood the tunnel behind him , exactly as Mola Ram does to Indy in Temple of Doom . In addition to all this , the whip action is great as Zorro disarms villains , swings to safety , etc . with his trusty lash . Most of the sword work is fair to lame , except for chapter one , which features a terrific sword brawl in a cantina choreographed by sword/stunt legend Ralph Faulkner , who makes a rare screen appearance as the evil Rodriguez . This was the first serial I ever saw , on Matinée at the Bijou when I was a kid and I have been hooked on them ever since . Zorro 's Fighting Legion delivers `` Z '' goods !
Escaping the life of being pimped by her father ( ..and the speakeasy waitressing ) who dies in an explosion , Lily Powers ( Barbara Stanwyck , who is simply ravishing ) sluts her way through the branches inside a bank business in big city Gotham . When a possessive lover murders who was supposed to be his next father-in-law ( and Lily 's new lover ) , the sky 's the limit for Lily as she has written down her various relationships in a diary and subtlety makes it known the papers will receive it if certain pay does n't come into her hands . Newly appointed president to the bank , Courtland Trenholm ( George Brent ) , sends Lily to Paris instead of forking over lots of dough , but soon finds himself madly in love after various encounters with her in the City of Love . This makes Lily 's mouth water as now she 'll have reached the pedestal of success seducing a man of wealth and prestige bring riches her way . Though , circumstances ensue which will bring her to make a decision that threatens her successful way of achieving those riches..Trenholm , now her husband , is being indicted with jail certain and has lost the bank . He needs money Lily now has in her possession or he 'll have absolutely nothing . Stanwyck is the whole movie despite that usual Warner Brothers polish . Being set in the pre-code era gives the filmmakers the chance to elaborate on taboo subjects such as a woman using sex to achieve success and how that can lead to tragedy . Good direction from Alfred E Green shows through subtlety hints in different mannerisms and speech through good acting from the seductive performance of Stanwyck how to stage something without actually showing the explicit act . Obviously the film shows that money is n't everything and all that jazz as love comes into the heart of Lily 's dead heart . That ending having Lily achieve the miraculous metamorphosis into someone in love did n't ring true to me . She 's spent all this time to get to that platform only to fall for a man who was essentially no different than others she had used before him .
A series of random , seemingly insignificant thefts at her sister 's boarding house has Miss Lemon quite agitated . A ring , light bulbs , a rucksack , a lighter , a stethoscope , a shoe  there seems to be no rhyme or reason to any of it . Miss Lemon asks her employer , the great Belgian detective Hercule Poirot , to look into the matter . But what Poirot sees is something far more sinister than Miss Lemon could have imagined . And Poirot 's fears are confirmed when one of the students living in the boarding house if found murdered . It 's up to Poirot to bring a killer to justice . Hickory Dickory Dock is a solid , but not spectacular , entry in the long running Poirot series . I appreciate how faithful the script is to Agatha Christie 's original story . I realize that certain liberties had to be taken , but I appreciate the effort nonetheless . The major points of the mystery are all there  the petty thefts , the boarding house , the students , the ripped rucksack , and , of course , Poirot 's ability to see something sinister going on before it actually happens . With a few exceptions , the cast of students is almost as I pictured them . Damian Lewis and Jessica Lloyd standout among the group . As mush as I always enjoy David Suchet 's Poirot , I get a real kick out of the episodes with Phillip Jackson 's Inspector Japp and Pauline Moran 's Miss Lemon . This episode is a real treat as Miss Lemon gets more screen time than usual . Finally , I enjoyed the use of the ever present mouse as an observer of the activities in the hostel . It 's a fun little play on the Hickory Dickory Dock title . I realized while re-watching Hickory Dickory Dock just what a tremendous influence Agatha Christie 's work was on the highly stylized Italian mystery films , or Gialli , of the 60s and 70s . Take the murder of Mrs. Nicoletis as an example . If you were to bump up the graphic nature of the scene , you would have something straight out of an early 70s Giallo . In fact , the entire plot of Hickory Dickory Dock could have been used in a Giallo . It 's just convoluted and interesting enough to have worked .
Guinea Pig : The Devil 's Experiment is without a doubt ***** stars on first view , its a raw realistic creepy and disturbing look into the dark side of human nature . This movie gets right to the point , you may be thinking what point ? The point is to satisfy fan 's of just extreme violence and gore . This movie has some gore , more or less just torturing a women violently . There are really only 3 scene 's that could be considered gore . I 'll tell you one thing though Guinea Pig : The Devil 's Experiment makes Hostile look like Sesame Street . If you thought Hostile was a crazy brutal disturbing torture flick then you ai n't seen the half of it until you 've seen Guinea Pig : The Devil 's Experiment . Movie Rating 0-5 , Gore 0-10 Guinea Pig : The Devil 's Experiment ( Uncut ) ***** ( 7 )
From a modern sensibility , it 's sometimes hard to watch older films . It 's annoying to have to watch the stereotypical wallflower librarian have to take off her glasses and become pretty and stupid to win a man . Especially such a shallow and inconstant man . He 's obviously a player ( I would n't trust him to stay true to her ) who does n't want to settle down , who only looks at dumb attractive women and always calls them `` baby '' ( ick ! ) . Even after she totally changes her appearance and her life for him , he only goes to her after he 's ( supposedly ) rejected by another woman and learns that Connie spent all her money renovating a boat for him . I wanted her to stand up to him , not pathetically chase after him ! His sudden conversion within a few minutes was totally unrealistic and did not work for me . Apart from that subplot , I did like the movie . How can you not like sailors dancing with each other ? ! ( You can tell they were from San Francisco ... . ; D ) The `` rehearsal '' dance was great , watching Ginger Rogers purposefully fall in and out of the `` correct steps '' was great . The last dance scene `` Face the Music '' with the beautiful costumes and the art deco set was beautiful . And I really enjoyed `` We Saw the Sea '' ( though they did use it a few too many times , as if they realized it was their best song ) . Anyway , the plot was a bit weak , like most musicals ( IMO ) - and the songs were OK , but the dancing was worth watching the film for . I wish they could have showed some shots of San Francisco since that was were the film was supposedly set . It 's also weird to see such a lighthearted naval film with the knowledge of what Hitler was already doing at that time . I have to try to suspend all knowledge to submerge myself into a made up fantasy land .
Clair Denis again revisits her theme of estranged fathers , men who follow their own bliss in determined fashion , heedless of the emotion toll on their family but while Nénette and Boni from the earlier film live in a narrow world of Marseilles , our examination of Louis Trebor in The Intruder takes us from a remote location along the French-Swiss border to half way around the world , to Korea and Tahiti . Again the film begins in mid stream , with Louis , in his sixties , coping with an ailing heart while attempting to maintain a high level of fitness . We learn that Louis is no stranger to violence as his cabin is the location for smuggling and gunfire a regular occurrence . Louis sleeps with a large knife under his pillow with rifles nearby . Denis is in no hurry to move the action along , and we must patiently build our understanding of Louis from his daily activities and the few people he deals with along the frontier including a son , Sidney ( Grégoire Colin , almost unrecognizable with long hair and a wisp of a mustache ) who rejects him as a `` lunatic '' : , shown as a dedicated father of two . There are many brief scenes which , while seemingly unrelated , build up an impression of Louis and his milieu . Ms Godard 's camera work is exhilarating here . The controlling metaphor is Louis 's heart transplant for which he goes to Korea and then to Tahiti to search for another son , not found , and where Louis 's new heart rejects him just as Sidney rejected the old . We are accustomed to brief scenes in Denis 's film which are inexplicable : Nénette astride Boni feeding with a spoon ; a drive by shooting of Boni 's father and then the briefest of images of Boni with a gunshot wound in the head ; a scene of Louis in a morgue with a cadaver with the scar of a transplant but the body of Sidney . The implication , of the last two , is a rejection , real or imagined , by a father , kills something indefinable in a son .
I got this one a few weeks ago and love it ! It 's modern , light but filled with true complexities of life . It questions and answers , just like other Eytan Fox movies . This is my favorite , along with Jossi & Jagger . This pictures a lot more , universally , than only the bubbles we may live in . You do n't need to be Jewish or homosexual to enjoy this - I 'm not , but the movie goes directly to my top ten movies . At first it seems like pure entertainment but it does make you think further . Relationships we have to live with are superficial , meaningful , deep , fatal , you name it . You do n't know what 's coming , and you definitely do n't know where this story is heading as you watch it the first time . It is worth seeing several times . Fox movies include great bonus material - here a great music video and `` the making of '' ( including explanation of the title , interviewing Lior Ashknenazi who plays himself in the movie and Arabs with doubts about the Israeli life styles ) .
Finally , an indie film that actually delivers some great scares ! I see most horror films that come out ... Theatrical , Straight-To-DVD , cable , etc ... and most of them suck ... a few are watchable ... even fewer are actually good ... Dark Remains is one of the good ones . I caught a screening of this film at the South Padre Island Film Festival ... the audience loved it ... and my wife and I loved it ! Having no name actors , I assume the budget on this film was pretty low , but you would n't know it ... the film looks fantastic ... the acting totally works for the film ... the story is good ... and the scares are great ! While most filmmakers focus solely on the scares , they often forget about story and character development , two things that help to deliver the scares more efficiently . Brian Avenet-Bradley must know that character and story are important . He develops both to the point where you care about the characters , you know the characters , and are therefore more scared when they are in danger . Watching horror films that cost anywhere from $ 80 million to $ 5000 to make , I find `` Dark Remains '' to be one of the gems out there . Check this film out !
***SPOILERS*** ***SPOILERS*** After two so-so outings ( `` Magnum Force '' and `` The Enforcer '' ) , Dirty Harry seems to have regained his stride in `` Sudden Impact , '' a gripping thriller that wisely plays to its strengths : the charisma of Clint Eastwood , who also directed , and a story that spends just enough time on exposition and reserves its energy for the big scenes . For once , the case takes Harry outside his native San Francisco ( where he 's again in trouble with his superiors for his `` shoot first , ask questions later '' tactics ) , to the hamlet of San Paulo . There , ( WARNING : Potential spoiler ) a group of lowlifes is being gruesomely murdered , one at a time , by a woman whom they gang-raped years earlier , and whose sister has been in a state of catatonia ever since the attack . The killer is portrayed by Sondra Locke , and she makes the character of Jennifer Spencer an interesting mix of compassion and cold-bloodedness . Locke 's cold eyes and frosty voice , when either trying to comfort her hospitalized sister or dispensing vengeance toward the rapists , are very effective in painting a portrait of a woman wronged whose years of suffering and rage are now beginning to bear deadly fruit . The rapists are a despicable lot , especially the leader , who has `` psycho nutjob '' practically stamped on his forehead , and a lesbian who seems almost one of the guys , despite her anatomical inability to participate . The flashback scenes , while not graphically explicit , are nightmarish enough , and clearly intended to make the audience cheer for Jennifer as she kills her assailants . Some will dismiss `` Sudden Impact '' as trash : a mindless , manipulative revenge tale . On a certain level this is true , but it 's well-done trash . What works to the movie 's advantage is the strength of the Sondra Locke performance , giving us a complex character whose wounds are more visible in her paintings than in her gestures or speech . What we have here is an action movie with a point of view . You can take or leave the idea that some wrongs deserve to be punished by any means necessary , but as the mystery behind the slayings becomes clear to Harry ( a realization that , wisely , is not spelled out with dialogue ) , he is presented with a choice -- what to do about a killer whose motivations he can sympathize with but whose conduct he is bound by law to not tolerate . This makes the story more interesting than the usual Dirty Harry fare . The movie 's other redeeming quality is Eastwood 's direction . This is , after all , a Dirty Harry movie , and Eastwood knows the character better than anyone else . The movie is directed with style and wit , and edited to give the action scenes a big payoff . Some of the best `` Harry moments '' in the entire series are here , including Harry 's best-known line , `` Go ahead -- make my day . '' `` Sudden Impact '' is a movie that has the courage of its convictions in presenting a tale about a despicable crime and the brutal consequences that follow . It is also a riveting detective story , well made and well told . And it is certainly never dull . On those criteria , it succeeds tremendously .
Neatly skipping over everything from the coup in Cuba to his undercover entry into Bolivia , part two of Soderbergh 's portrayal of Che Guevara is that of the tragic hero . As with Che  Part One , this rather rambling guerrilla warfare escapade through the colourful mountains of Bolivia is probably destined to disappoint more people than it will satisfy , so why was the film ( and particularly Benicio Del Toro 's performance ) so loudly praised at Cannes ? James Rocchi , for instance , called it , a work of art that 's , `` not just the story of a revolutionary , '' but , `` a revolution in and of itself . '' The Guardian 's Peter Bradshaw called it a `` flawed masterpiece . '' I return to my original contention for Part One  that the value lies particularly in depiction of a hero figure . And in an age when there is a surfeit of poor hero role-models , could it not be salutary to see a strongly honourable one , even if stripped of some of the less endearing episodes of his life ? This is the psychological hero enshrined by the great Scottish essayist , Thomas Carlyle , in his seminal book , Heroes and Hero Worship . Heroes can be real or imaginary ( or somewhere in-between ) . But should genuinely inspire us to higher goals , a higher purpose . Compare this with the unrealistic 'heroes ' of standard Western storytelling : where a person undergoes trials and tribulations before obtaining a barely-believable reward  usually everlasting love or material wealth  as if by divine studio intervention . Real heroes have an excess of moral courage  not Lost Ark dare-devilishness or James Bond super-toys . They rise , and empower others to rise , to be the best that they can be . In Part One , Che succeeds . In Part Two , he fails . It is not for want of moral courage but since a ) not all good plans can succeed and b ) being human , mistakes are inevitable . Guevara 's intellectual clarity is flawed when he equates conditions that justify armed struggle with conditions that make that armed struggle able to succeed . It is a serious miscalculation . High in the mountains from La Paz , the colours are breathtaking . There is an air of mise-en-scene authenticity that was occasionally lacking in Che - Part One ( The U.S. would not allow Soderbergh to film in Cuba . ) Visual treats are heightened by maximising natural light and the extreme flexibility and realism offered with groundbreaking RED cameras . This is a high performance digital cine camera with the quality of 35mm film and the convenience of pure digital . Designed for flexibility and functionality , the package weighs a mere 9 lbs . `` Shooting with RED is like hearing the Beatles for the first time , '' says Soderbergh . `` RED sees the way I see . . . so organic , so beautifully attuned to that most natural of phenomena  light . '' If Che had stopped with the successful Cuban revolution it would have enshrouded him with an almost mystical invincibility . That he fails in Bolivia shows not only that he has human limitations but that it is his moral virtues that are remembered , not the political triumph . Critics will say  and with some justification - that his armed struggle inspired much less noble characters to achieve tin-pot dictatorships . His development of guerrilla fighting tactics are not good or bad in themselves ( and have since been used for both ) . But for all its praiseworthiness , the film often seems to lack dramatic and narrative tension . We stumble from one escapade to another , knowing that he will eventually meet his death . I found myself glancing at my watch and thinking it could have been shorter . But the work that has gone into this  interviews with people from all sides and even getting one of Guevara 's ex-comrades to coach actors on the minutiae of the Bolivian operations  make the film a commendable achievement . It might not be top-flight entertainment , but it demonstrates integrity in documenting a significant slice of history . There is also another very important point in the Che 'hero ' figure here . It 's about failure . That if you try your utmost , even if you fail , your effort will not have been in vain because it may give others hope and moral courage . One could cynically call it a 'martyr ' complex , and it is found , of course , in many religious figures as well . But Che does not 'sacrifice ' himself . He does what he does best , to the best of his not inconsiderate ability , and so provides an example . Success or failure in any particular instance become mere details . With the U.S. 's longstanding and illegal blockade of Cuba ( all in the name of 'freedom ' ) , I am tempted to write that Che Parts 1 & 2 are too good to be wasted on the U.S . But that would be to invite a contention that the film has sought so earnestly to avoid . One must hope that many viewers will have the skill to view Che without politics and the bias that inevitably engenders . Whatever its faults , it rehabilitates Soderbergh from the populist nonsense of Oceans 11 . But if you have n't heard of Che Guevara or seen Part One , or if you ca n't get past the phrase 'murderous Marxist ' without frothing at the mouth , I might struggle to imagine what you would get from this film . The same can be said for many who have , and can .
Before I see on this film , I see a lot of comments , which everyone has a great view of the film good or bad ... What I really want to point out is the acting on Woody Harrelson behalf , he may not be in many parts of the film , but when he appears or even the intro , I was astonished by Will Smith 's and Woody Harrelson `` message '' they tried to create and maybe slip the entire plot until the end to really understand what is going on . I am not a very sentimental person , I believe that a good deed should not have remorse or pity behind it . But a act to show redemption , there is not many films that in my point of view can show this . This is one of them that can . I agree with one person that commented about this film showing acts of `` suicide '' is a downfall , however I do not believe that is the `` message '' the film is trying to send , but `` sacrifice '' . A bit to the extreme , but that is the message in MY opinion . This film has potential . The acting it is worth every penny , the script is unbelievable . from a person that does n't really like watching drama films ... if you like drama this is a must go watch .
Heh , if I tell you to compare The Dark Knight with some 18-years-old comics-adapted movie rated 5.9 , will you call me crazy ? That 's just to catch your attention . Everyday I meet people complaining there are no good movies , who seem to only know the recent blockbusters . It 's never a bad thing to search and explore old movies , especially those with good artistic values . Dick Tracy is one of those ca n't be easily outdated , in terms of technology . The negative reviews mainly complained about DT 's `` messed up '' story . But it appears to me that the storyline is quite clear , and I had no problem following it . I did n't see the comic books , yet I am not a huge US comic fan , but I appreciate the top-notch film-making and performances . Maybe the expectations of most people were too high about the story it would tell . But , if you see a movie casting Madonna and Warren Beatty together , what would you expect . I had some scratches on my head , and ca n't help but wonder , did we really see the same movie ? The title role , although not as competent as it sounds , still was able to pull him up and charm the audiences . Madonna was more express-less than `` breathless '' in her seductive role , but added a lot of fun to the story . Al Pacino was funny and prodigy to himself . Apparently he 's bold enough to go sarcastic on his previously successful roles . We can see a hybrid of Scarface , Michael Corleone , Adolf Hitler and Robert De Niro punching our stomaches to make us laugh . And many thanks to make-ups . To me it 's not bad at all . The surreal feeling really got me .
Not wishing to give *anything* away here , I would just say this technically excellent , flawlessly acted and uplifting little flic will reward the viewer with an excellent hour and a half 's entertainment : It will amuse , surprise , possibly embarrass occasionally and almost certainly tug at the heartstrings from time to time , as it approaches the inevitable , but not obvious , ending without becoming clichéd or predictable in any way . Most definitely recommended . A previous User 's Comment gives 8 out of 10 for the film and 10 out of 10 for both Branagh and Bonham-Carter 's outstanding performances - I agree entirely ... .
I saw this movie in the theater , and was thoroughly impressed by it . Then again , that was when Claire Danes was a good actress , not the foolish , arrogant , Hollywood-ized bitch she is today . Anyway , this film really struck me as one of the more raw , realistic , beautiful friendship films . How far would you really go for your best friend ? I was moved to tears at the end , and still tear up when I watch it now ( I own it ) . I remember as soon as I left the theater , I called my best friend and sobbed to her how much I loved her . This is a great film to watch with your best girlfriend . However be prepared for the almost certain conversation afterward where she turns to you and asks if you 'd do something like that for her ... .
Reed Hadley makes a better foppish Don Diego than he does a dashing and daring Zorro , but that 's almost beside the point because this serial features the bar-none best theme song of any serial , ever -- and the best version of Yakima Canutt 's famous stagecoach stunt . There are other good stunts , and lots of action , and plenty of hair-raising cliff-hanger chapter endings , but if for no other reason , you must see this film to watch the stagecoach stunt , then re-watch it in slow motion . It is incredible , and , despite the lower budget for this chapter play , Yak turns in a better take on the stunt here than he did in the far more celebrated film `` Stagecoach . '' Indiana Jones , eat your heart out : This is the real deal !
Do n't know how this missed award nominations . Great film . Certainly of the calibre of `` Beautiful Mind '' Great acting , photography , script and drama . I ca n't imagine anyone not being entranced by this film .
First of all , I loved Bruce Broughton 's music score , very lyrical , and this alone added to the film 's charm . The best aspect of the movie were the three animals , superlatively voiced by Michael J.Fox , Sally Field and the late Don Ameche . Whereas Fox has the funniest lines , Ameche plays a rather brooding otherwise engaging character ( the voice of reason ) , and Field adds wit into a character that is always seen telling Chance off . The humans were n't as engaging , and sometimes the film dragged , but that is my only complaint . This is one beautiful-looking film , with beautiful close up shots of Canada , I believe . Although the film itself is quite long , there is never a seriously dull moment , and this is advantaged by the voice work and a well-written script . All in all , a charming and perhaps underrated film , with a 9/10 from me . Bethany Cox .
Remember H.G . Wells ' `` The Invisible Man '' ? Well here 's another movie like it , only more extreme . `` Hollow Man '' is like no one story about invisibility as a weapon of choice . Kevin Bacon plays Sebastian Caine , a scientific genius who goes out into the world of invisibility and making it useful for military purposes . At first making the serum was the easy part , making the person come back was not . Most of the first tries ended up unstable . Until one night , when he perfected the formula . And who else , but Caine would be the lab rat . The gorilla was the first and almost died , so when he came to , it was a close one . So when the did Caine , he decided to use it for fun . Then when he got tired of being not seen , the team tried their best to bring him back to the world of the flesh . However , the visibility formula happens to not work the way it should , and Caine would delve into madness . So he ends up being one mad invisible killer . It would be best to just get out of town instead of taking the lives of people that are close to you . I would care less about the ones who did you wrong . Great movie , plenty of fun . 3 out of 5 stars !
Embarrassingly , I just watched this movie for the first time , 13 years after its release . It 's a story that any father or brother can relate to ... one brother is a bit 'wild , ' the other brother is the typical older child . Craig Sheffer is a little too unemotional as the oldest brother , but Pitt is amazing , and Skerritt is perfectly cast as the father . The fishing scenes that were filmed in Montana are absolutely breathtaking ... I had no idea that fly fishing could be so attractive . The movie closely follows the book , with only a few modifications to make it more appropriate for a movie format . Unlike most book to movie stories , this one measures up . It 's a perfect movie for anyone who wants a quiet night with a powerful and somewhat emotional movie .
Buddy is an entertaining family film set in a time when `` humanizing '' animals , and making them cute was an accepted way to get people to be interested in them . Based on a true story , Buddy shows the great love that the main characters have for animals and for each other , and that they will do anything for each other . While not a perfect movie , the animated gorilla is quite lifelike most of the time and the mayhem that occurs within the home is usually amusing for children . This film misses an opportunity to address the mistake of bringing wild animals into the home as pets , but does show the difficulties . A recommended film which was the first for Jim Henson Productions .
I found it highly interesting that the film actually managed to bridge the gap between my own american culture and that of the originators , i.e . chinese . It becomes a story about values , and causes the watcher to reevaluate their own choices in life , and loyalties toward institutions . Amazingly enough , it managed to do this in a gentle , mildly humorous manner , which only in retrospect seens threatening to one 's status quo . I enjoyed the movie , and would watch it again if I could .
I remember seeing this film at the West End theater in Louisville , Kentucky when I was a boy . The scene where Dr. Carmus finds the gardener 's coffin , and the breathing dead body therein , was the scariest part of the movie for me , only intensified by the darkness of the film . I also wondered about the people hanging from the trees at the end , until I recognized the part of the film in which the family name of the Blackwoods was changed from Blackblood , due to the fact that in the family history there was a character who was known for his many hangings of various people . Sir Thomas Blackwood seemed to get his kicks out of adding to the deaths caused by his family . I also noticed that as Foster first enters the gate of the cemetery , he is careful in noticing the sharp object of the gate , where he meets his end . I would not hesitate to recommend this film to horror movie lovers .
Watched this last night and was bowled over by the heartfelt story line , the excellent character development , and the good karmic vibe emanating from the acting and movie as a whole . Without giving away too much of the plot , it begins with an ordinary joe who commutes to his office job every day who becomes inspired to take dance lessons . Along the way the protagonist and the assorted characters he meets in his quest to be smooth on the dance floor learn lessons about others and about themselves . The story has a prologue about what dancing in Japan symbolizes sociologically , so it is n't exactly as simple to learn to dance in Japan as it is here in the U.S . The film is lighthearted ; you 'll laugh out loud at some of the sight gags . Yet it is also dignified in a way hard to describe . All of the film 's characters are taken seriously , as they are , and none are diminished because of their `` imperfections . '' I 've been thinking about taking social dance classes with some friends . It just so happened a friend lent me the video on learning to dance . Is this synchronous or what ? I think so because now I 'm really geeked to give it a try . Watch this wonderful family film ( small children might not get it , but teens certainly would ) and smile at the genuine caring you see shown in it time and again . Why they would make a remake of Shall We Dance is a mystery , as it is perfect as-is .
A meltdown at a nuclear power plant causes a majority of people to turn into lethal , rot-faced , shambling zombies who naturally go on a grisly rampage . A ragtag handful of uninfected folks do their best to survive this grueling ordeal . Director/co-writer/producer Todd Sheets displays an appealingly sincere love and passion for go-straight-for-the-throat lively and gruesome horror fare : he maintains an unflagging snappy pace throughout , fills the screen with wall-to-wall crazy action , and thankfully keeps the terrible dialogue to a pleasing minimum . Moreover , Sheets certainly does n't skimp on the gloriously graphic and excessive over-the-top splatter : this picture delivers a tasty truckload of flesh melting , evisceration , lots of gut munching , one dude has his heart yanked out , and there 's even a nice impalement on a tree branch . Sheets earns bonus points for keeping the tone grim and nasty to the literal bitter end ( for example , almost all of the main characters wind up becoming zombie chow ) . Granted , this flick has its fair share of flaws : the ragged editing , several ham-fisted attempts at pathos , and the largely awful acting from a rank no-name cast all leave a good deal to be desired . Top thespic honors go to the pretty and perky Kasey Rausch for her winningly spunky portrayal of the resourceful Daria Trumillio . Frank Dunlay likewise does well as rugged take-charge army veteran Ralph Walsh . Best of all , Sheets ' sure grasp of an infectiously slambang sense of unrelenting headlong momentum and obvious affinity for the horror genre ensure that this remains a total blast to watch from start to finish .
This is the first must see film I 've seen in the last year ! It 's wickedly funny , incredibly original , unbelievably great looking ( they went for this super cool wide-screen Technicolor look that 's awesome to behold , ) and it actually has depth in character and in what it says about society . It 's really smart satire that nails everything from Homeland Security to race issues , while at the same time leaving you laughing and realizing how much are world lives in fear . Carrie Anne Moss turns in a comedic performance I never imagined would come from her ! She 's sweet , funny and sexy ! Billy Connolly is great as Fido who can only grunt and moan ! And Dylan Baker as the Dad is priceless . In fact the whole cast is perfect . Henry Czerny as the bad guy , Tim Blake Nelson as the neighbor with the hot sexy zombie girlfriend ( getting the idea now ? ) Funny , though-provoking and just all round amazing ! Go and see this movie ! It 's like nothing you 've ever seen before .
First of all , this film was not released to theatres ( TESTED POORLY THEY SAY ) , I say they figured the story of crooked cops , politicians & dedicated newspaper people had been done to death , just send it DVD & cable TV > & take the money & run . That being said I usually like this type of movie , especially with this named cast . Morgan Freeman , Justin Timberlake , Kevin Spacey , L.L.Cool J , Cary Elways , John Heard & on the distaff side , Piper Perabo & Roslyn Sanchez . The plot & story have been done to death , BUT the above cast brings life to this violent movie & it is actually watchable . Justin Timberlake Is good as the dedicated young reporter for a throw-away newspaper edited by Morgan Freeman , The others are either crooked Cops , & Politicians or somewhat decent guys , The 2 ladies are the girl friends of LL COOL J & JUSTIN TIMBERLAKE & do whats required , It is quite violent , many killings etc , not for children . By no means is the a great film , BUT for what it is & the cast It is definitely good , Ratings *** ( out of 4 ) 86 points ( out of 100 ) IMDb 8 ( out of 10 )
This movie is exciting , daring and the music is very good.The movie Moonwalker was meant to coincide with the album Bad ( 1987 ) .I have Bad.It is excellent ( ***** ) .The movie begins with Michael Jackson performing '' Man In The Mirror '' on stage.then , it shows a history of Michael , from his early days in the Jackson 5 right up to the Bad era . Oh , and Badder is good too ( Badder is a music video parody of the music video for Bad the single ) .It then shows the Speed Demon video.The song and the video are very , very good indeed.Same for leave me alone , which appears after.Then it shows the movie Moonwalker.after a few minutes , he plays smooth criminal in a club called club 30s.like it when he does the lean.anyway , nice to see you.bye bye .
First saw this gem from Joe Sarno way back when , and I must say that after seeing it , I could never forget Jennifer Welles . At first I thought the film was moving a bit slower than i would expect for a Sarno film , but when Jennifer made her entrance , the first time I ever saw her anywhere , I was sat up and took notice . Her presence in this film is hard to avoid , and spices up every scene she 's involved in . I 've seen most of the rest of Sarno 's films , and the other films starring or featuring Jennifer Welles , and I must say that this was both Sarno and Jennifer at their collective best . Sarno 's direction in this film of domestic adult drama is superb , and Jennifer showed ( figuratively and literally ) an acting prowess that make this a must see . Co-stars Rebecca Brooke ( aka Mary Mendum ) and Chris Jordan , both frequent co-stars of Ms. Welles , and also frequent stars of Sarno 's work , turn in believable performances as a pair of adventurous , yet normal housewives . This film is Sarno classic .
I watch romantic comedies with some hesitation , for romantic comedies feature age old clichés which make a movie uninteresting . Typically in a Romantic Comedy , there is a girl and there is a guy , both fall in love , then have troubles , and then win over the troubles to marry or whatever . But , this movie is a different story , it is really very different from the Romantic Comedies I have seen of lately . There is a widowed guy ( Dan ) , there is a girl ( Marie ) . Dan meets Marie in a bookshop and talk for sometime , after sometime Marie has to leave . Dan develops something for her , and when this something starts to turn meaningful , we get a twist . Marie is the girlfriend of his brother . Unheeded of the circumstances , Dan flirts with Marie and realizes that he loves her , and even Marie loves him , but their love would not just be possible . How it is made possible forms the rest of the story . Steve Carell performs well , Juliette Binoche is good as Marie . And every other stuff is done well . It is a good movie , watch it .
Popular radio storyteller Gabriel No one ( Robin Williams , scraggy and speaking in hushed , hypnotic tones ) becomes acquainted and friends with a fourteen-year-old boy from Wisconsin named Pete Logand ( Rory Culkin ) , who has written a book detailing sexual abuse from his parents . To boot , Pete has AIDS and this compels Gabriel further still , since his partner Jess ( Bobby Cannavale , good ) happens to be a survivor of HIV himself . He also acquaints himself with Pete 's guardian , a woman named Donna ( Toni Collette , brilliant ! ) and when Gabriel decides he wants to meet and talk to the two of them in person and goes to Wisconsin , he discovers some secrets he was ( naturally ) not prepared to find . Based on real events that happened to Armistead Maupin ( who co-wrote the screenplay with Terry Anderson ) and directed by Patrick Stetner , this film moves a lot faster ( 90 min. , maybe a few minutes longer ) than one might think a movie of this genre would run . That 's good in that it keeps the action and storyline lean and clear . It 's bad in that it leaves various holes in the plot and does n't sew-up any of the plot openings or back-story . I 'd rather not go into any great detail except to say that , if you are not familiar with Mr.Maupin 's works or his personal story , you feel a little bit out of the loop here . Still , the performances by Williams ( I would 've loved to heard more of his narration , personally ) , Collette , Cannavale , Culkin and much of the supporting cast ( the Waitress at the restaurant Collete 's Donna frequents does a great job with what small part she has ! ) are top-notch and the mood established here -- namely , the chilly , lonely dark exteriors of Wisconsin and New York -- give a terrific framing for this story . It may have ends that do n't tie together particularly well , but it 's still a compelling enough story to stick with .
There is a scene in Dan in Real Life where the family is competing to see which sex can finish the crossword puzzle first . The answer to one of the clues is Murphy 's Law : anything that can go wrong , will go wrong . This is exactly the case for Dan Burns ( Steve Carell , the Office ) a columnist for the local newspaper . Dan is an expert at giving advice for everyday life , yet he comes to realize that things are n't so picture perfect in his own . Dan in Real Life is amazing at capturing these ironies of everyday life and is successful at embracing the comedy , tragedy , and beauty of them all . Besides that this movie is pretty damn hilarious . The death of his wife forces Dan to raise his three daughters all on his own ... each daughter in their own pivotal stages in life : the first one anxious to try out her drivers license , the middle one well into her teenage angst phase , and the youngest one drifting away from early childhood . Things take a turn for Dan when he goes to Rhode Island for a family reunion and stumbles across an intriguing woman in a bookstore . Her name is Marie ( Juliette Binoche , Chocolat ) and she is looking for a book to help her avoid awkward situations ... which is precisely whats in store when they get thrown into the Burns Family household . If you 've seen Steve Carell in The Office or Little Miss Sunshine , you 'd know that he is incomparable with comedic timing and a tremendously dynamic actor as well . Steve Carell is awesome at capturing all the emotions that come with family life : the frustration and sincere compassion . The family as well as the house itself provides a warm environment for the movie that contrasts the inner turmoil that builds throughout the movie and finally bursts out in a pretty suspenseful climax . The movie only falls short in some of the predictable outcomes , yet at the same time life is made up of both irony and predictability : which is an irony within itself . Dan in Real Life is definitely worth seeing , for the sole enjoyment of watching all the funny subtleties we often miss in everyday life , and I 'll most likely enjoy it a second time , or even a third . Just `` put it on my tab . ''
Had this film been put together a tad better , it would be up there with the best of Astaire and Rogers . As it is , it 's a fine movie but overly long with a tedious subplot , i.e. , Randolph Scott romancing Rogers ' sister , played by Harriet Hilliard ( that 's Ozzie Nelson 's wife to you baby boomers ) . Astaire and Scott are two Navy men . Scott meets Hilliard the first time when she looks like a stereotypical librarian , and later on after Ginger Rogers has asked her friend ( a blond but unmistakable Lucille Ball ) to glamor her up . Meanwhile , Astaire tries to pick up where he and his old dancing partner left off . The result is some wonderful dance numbers , with Astaire and Rogers as a team as well as separately : `` I 'm Putting All My Eggs in One Basket , '' `` Let Yourself Go , '' and `` I 'd Rather Lead the Band . '' Hilliard is sweet but a little lethargic as a plain Jane turned glamor girl , although she sings her two songs well , `` But Where Are You ? '' and `` Get Thee Behind Me , Satan '' - one poster did n't care for that song , but I love the title . Rogers is vivacious , and a youthful Astaire is a dynamo . The highlight of the movie comes at the end with `` Let 's Face the Music and Dance , '' one of the most achingly beautiful songs ever written and certainly one of the most brilliantly executed by Rogers and Astaire . In it , they epitomize '30s glamor and fantasy . It is truly to be treasured and watched again and again .
I 've just watched Roll and what a pleasure it turned out to be . Toby Malone 's performance really stood out , I found myself actually caring about what happens to Matt throughout the whole of the film , which itself is a lot of fun , very pacey with a good mix of well rounded characters , quite an achievement considering it 's short running time . There are plenty of good twists throughout as well , it will keep you guessing until the end . Other characters to watch out for are the totally insane Tiny and the sneaky attractive Jesse . It may not have the huge budget of a Hollywood blockbuster but do n't let that put you off , you could do a lot worse than checking this out , you wo n't regret it . Good Fun . 7/10
A highly atmospheric cheapie , showing great ingenuity in the use of props , sets and effects ( fog , lighting , focus ) to create an eerie and moody texture . The story is farfetched , the acting is merely functional , but it shows how imaginative effects can develop an entire visual narrative . This movie is recommended for its mood and texture , not for its story .
I used to watch this on either HBO or Showtime or Cinemax during the one summer in the mid 90 's that my parents subscribed to those channels . I came across it several times in various parts and always found it dark , bizarre and fascinating . I was young then , in my early teens ; and now years later after having discovered the great Arliss Howard and being blown away by `` Big Bad Love '' I bought the DVD of `` Wilder Napalm '' and re-watched it with my girlfriend for the first time in many years . I absolutely loved it ! I was really impressed and affected by it . There are so many dynamic fluid complexities and cleverness within the camera movements and cinematography ; all of which perfectly gel with the intelligent , intense and immediate chemistry between the three leads , their story , the music and all the other actors as well . It 's truly `` Cinematic '' . I love Arliss Howard 's subtle intensity , ambivalent strength and hidden intelligence , I 'm a big fan of anything he does ; and his interplay with Debra Winger 's manic glee ( they are of course married ) has that magic charming reality to it that goes past the camera . ( I wonder if they watch this on wedding anniversaries ? ... ... . `` Big Bad Love '' should be the next stop for anyone who has not seen it ; it 's brilliant . ) And , Dennis Quaid in full clown make-up , sneakily introduced , angled , hidden and displayed by the shot selection and full bloomed delivery is of the kind of pure dark movie magic you do n't see very often . Quaid has always had a sinister quality to him for me anyways , with that huge slit mouth span , hiding behind his flicker eyes lying in wait to unleash itself as either mischievous charm or diabolical weirdness ( here as both ) . Both Howard and Quaid have the insane fire behind the eyes to pull off their wonderful intense internal gunslinger square-offs in darkly cool fashion . In fact the whole film has a darkly cool energy and hip intensity . It 's really a fantastic film , put together by intelligence , imagination , agility and chemistry by all parties involved . I really can not imagine how this got funded , and it looks pretty expensive to me , by such a conventional , imagination-less system , but I thank God films like this slip through the system every once in awhile . In a great way , with all of its day-glo bright carnival colors , hip intelligence , darkly warped truthful humor and enthralling chemistry it reminds me of one of my favorite films of all time : `` Grosse Pointe Blank '' ... ... .now that 's a compliment in my book !
After watching the rather sloppy WW1 spy thriller , Madam Lili ( 1969 ) starring Julie Andrews on tv this afternoon , I suddenly thought I had seen a far superior WW1 spy thriller . All I could remember was that it was produced by Dino De Laurentis . It only took a short search on IMDB to find Fraulein Doktor . Once I recognised the title the memories came flooding back . It is , for its time , a reasonably well crafted story revolving around true events such as the death of Kitchener and the German offensives of 1918.It also has a female spy who is much more believable than Julie Andrews ! As with other reviewers the first and strongest memory was of the well produced battle scenes and of men and horses in gas masks . If you have an interest in war films and particularly WW1 it is a film well worth seeing if you have the opportunity .
When it came out , this was pretty much state of the art musical film entertainment . To this day it 's more entertaining than most , in great part because it has James Cagney in the lead role as a musical prologue producer under a succession of deadlines and sheltered from all storms by his trusty `` girl Friday '' played by Joan Blondell . Also the musical numbers towards the end which were put together by Busby Berkeley are pretty much a knock-out as far as that type of thing goes . But this is a pretty strange movie . I mean in one of those numbers , you 've got Billy Barty running around pretending to be a lovable toddler , doing all kinds of weird stuff . Ruby Keeler seems to have a sickening smile plastered on her face at all times , but at least she 's not required to act like in some of her later unfortunate films . You 'd never guess that Dick Powell was any kind of tough guy from seeing him in this movie ; apparently all the tough guy energy was allocated to the star Cagney . As for Cagney , his high speed rants about musical shows and so forth are endearing and annoying at the same time . After a while it gets a bit too much . You expect him to walk out and say , `` Hey ! I 've got a great idea for a prologue ! The women are cigarettes , and they come out of a pack of smokes ! Oh no , we did that one last month ! '' It 's funny but it gets a bit repetitive . In the moments where he has to get tough with the bad girl , Ruth Donnelly , some of the established Cagney gangster character comes out . In fact frequent B gangster director William Keighley is credited here with dialogue coaching , and it seems at times that Cagney and Blondell are invoking something very `` street '' even though the characters are n't criminal . The musical numbers ... what can you say ? They stand alone as entertainment , the way that Berkeley uses the human body and geometry is really startling . But none of them really mean anything . It means `` Honeymoon Hotel '' , nothing really more or less . And the whole pretense of the integration falls apart immediately , since the characters in the show are doing things that could n't possibly be appreciated by a theater audience like the movie portrays . For example at one point they show the fine print on a newspaper , things like that . The whole thing could only exist on film , so the idea that the prologues are actually live shows is ridiculous . I can only suppose that audiences of the time were somewhat less critical about things like this than they would be ten years later or so , because this is a very polished production . It 's great to see Cagney himself show off his superb dancing skills , and he can actually share the stage with a dancer like Keeler . Cagney and Blondell have excellent chemistry and their scenes go off really well . The music I would say is only mediocre , but mostly pleasing if repetitive . Bacon 's direction in general is very suitable but never interesting . The film 's entertainment value is unquestionable and it has also picked up some nostalgic value along the way . It 's a cut above most `` let 's put on a show '' films of the 30s .
A fine Martino outing , this is a spirited and enjoyable giallo with fine performances from good looking cast and principally the two leads , George Hilton and Anita Strindberg . For me the jig-saw puzzle of a plot is so convoluted and confusing you just sit back and enjoy rather than try to anticipate . Just when all seems resolved we are again taken on a further series of twists , enjoyable twists , it has to be said . Sexy with plenty of gory kills this a well paced movie with London , Athens and Greek coastal locations . A super finale set upon Aegean rocks wraps things up and much fun was had by all .
Gregory Peck gives a brilliant performance in this film . The last 15 minutes ( or thereabouts ) are great and Peck is an absolute joy to watch . The same can not however be said for the rest of the film . It 's not awful and I 'm sure it was made with good intentions , but the only real reason ( if I were to be honest ) to see it is Peck . For the rest you are better off just reading the Old Testament .
Halfway through Lajos Koltai 's `` Evening , '' a woman on her deathbed asks a figure appearing in her hallucination : `` Can you tell me where my life went ? '' The line could be embarrassingly theatrical , but the woman speaking it is Vanessa Redgrave , delivering it with utter simplicity , and the question tears your heart out . Time and again , the film based on Susan Minot 's novel skirts sentimentality and ordinariness , it holds attention , offers admirable performances , and engenders emotional involvement as few recent movies have . With only six months of the year gone , there are now two memorable , meaningful , worthwhile films in theaters , the other , of course , being Sara Polley 's `` Away from Her . '' Hollywood might have turned `` Evening '' into a slick celebrity vehicle with its two pairs of real-life mothers and daughters - Vanessa Redgrave and Natasha Richardson , and Meryl Streep and Mamie Gummer . Richardson is Redgrave 's daughter in the film ( with a sister played by Tony Collette ) , and Gummer plays Streep 's younger self , while Redgrave 's youthful incarnation is Claire Danes . Add Glenn Close , Eileen Atkins , Hugh Dancy , Patrick Wilson , and a large cast - yes , it could have turned into a multiple star platform . Instead , Koltai - the brilliant Hungarian cinematographer of `` Mephisto , '' and director of `` Fateless '' - created a subtle ensemble work with a `` Continental feel , '' the story taking place in a high-society Newport environment , in the days leading up to a wedding that is fraught with trouble . Missed connections , wrong choices , and dutiful compliance with social and family pressures present quite a soap opera , but the quality of the writing , Koltai 's direction , and selfless acting raise `` Evening '' way above that level , into the the rarified air of English , French ( and a few American ) family sagas from a century before its contemporary setting . Complex relationships between mothers and daughters , between friends and lovers , with the addition of a difficult triangle all come across clearly , understandably , captivatingly . Individual tunes are woven into a symphony . And yet , with the all the foregoing emphasis on ensemble and selfless performances , the stars of `` Evening '' still shine through , Redgrave , Richardson , Gummer ( an exciting new discovery , looking vaguely like her mother , but a very different actress ) , Danes carrying most of the load - until Streep shows up in the final moments and , of course , steals the show . Dancy and Wilson are well worth the price of admission too . As with `` Away from Her , '' `` Evening '' stays with you at length , inviting a re-thinking its story and characters , and re-experiencing the emotions it raises . At two hours , the film runs a bit long , but the way it stays with you thereafter is welcome among the many movies that go cold long before your popcorn .
I would say that this film gives an insight to the trauma that a young mind can face when a family is split by divorce or other disaster . I would highly recommend this film especially to parents or individuals planning to have a family . I found the characters to be appealing and highly sympathetic from a multitude of dimensions . The scary monster although probably not scary to most adults , has a very real hint of what the overactive imagination of a child who is facing unknown terrors might create . I found the film to be delightful !
Overall , I enjoyed this film and would recommend it to indie film lovers . However , I really want to note the similarities between parts of this film and Nichols ' Closer . One scene especially where Adrian Grenier 's character is questioning Rosario Dawson 's about her sex life while he was away is remarkably similar to the scene in Closer where Clive Owen 's character is questioning Julia Roberts , although it is acted with less harshness and intensity in `` Love . '' Also note that `` Anna '' is the name of both Dawson 's and Roberts ' character . Ca n't be coincidence . Now Closer is based on Patrick Marber 's play and supposedly this film is loosely based on Arthur Schnitzler 's `` Reigen '' so I 'm not sure how this connection formed . Anyone have an idea ?
For Urban Cowboy John Travolta plays one of the stronger alpha males ever portrayed on the big screen . He 's a decent enough young kid who leaves his parent 's homestead and strikes out for the big city of Dallas where his uncle Barry Corbin has promised to find him work in the petrochemical industry . In 1980 that was beginning to boom and Texas was definitely a growing place in the USA . Travolta does a good job in making we the audience care about his character who when you come right down to it is a sexist pig . He meets and marries Debra Winger who 's from the same background , but she 's got some ideas that women should not be shadows of their men . And when she beats him at Gilley 's mechanical bull , a man 's game , that 's it for him . Scott Glenn who 's an ex-convict is working at Gilley 's and this film was his breakout role . He 's a real snake in Urban Cowboy , he gets Travolta 's goat with a mere look and he moves in on Winger . Travolta in turn takes up with rich girl , Madolyn Smith Osborne who 's slumming at Gilley 's . Despite the characters , Urban Cowboy was really one gigantic commercial for the self-styled biggest honky tonk in the world . Gilley 's is no longer there in the suburban Texas community of Pasadena , but the memories do live on . And the best thing about Urban Cowboy is the wonderful score of country/western songs that were featured in the film . I 'm not sure if some of the songs were not written specifically for Urban Cowboy , but it 's the only reason I can think of why the Motion Picture Academy ignored the musical aspects of this film . I especially liked Johnny Lee 's Looking For Love , if it was specifically written for this film , it 's a disgrace that it was n't nominated for Best Song . I liked Debra Winger 's character best in this film . She does n't lose a trace of femininity , but she stands up to Travolta and does it in style . And this review is dedicated to that yet as unknown woman who will one day be the first woman bull-rider in the Professional Bull Riders .
Just a note to add to the above comment . Fear of a Black Hat does n't have the criminal who 's image has been ripped off by the band , that 's in CB4 . Easily confused as the two films are so similar , but Black Hat is vastly the superior of the two ... .. yeah .
`` Roman Troy Moronie '' is my comment on the movie . What else is there to say ? This character really brings out the moron in Moronie . A tough gangster with an inability to pronounce profane words , well , it seems that it would have been frustrating to be tough and yet not be able to express oneself intelligently . Roman Moronie will go down in the annals of movie history as one of the greatest of all morons . There is of course great comedy among the other characters . Michael Keaton is F.A.H . and so is Joe Piscipo . I just like the fact that Moronie kept the movie from an `` R '' rating because he could not pronounce profanity .
From the director of movies 'Last Seduction ' and 'Kill me again ' , comes another movie in the noir style . John Dahl created a niche for himself by making movies on the themes of adultery , blackmailing in the early 90s . Though I did not have much of an opinion in regards to last seduction . But nowadays Mr Dahl has resorted to directing television shows.Its a shame since the man had talent . ***SPOILERS** This is quite an impressive movie which revolves around a drifter Cage ) that comes in to the town of Wyoming for a job . However he does not prove lucky and becomes mistaken for a hit-man from Texas by bar owner J.T Walsh . He is given the task to kill his wife ( Boyle ) . But Cage decides to split after taking the upfront payment without doing it . On the way out of town he accidentally hits a guy on the road , who he then takes back to the local hospital . At that point Cage coincidently meets Walsh again , who also appears to be the local sheriff . After that Cage escapes from his clutches but meets in to the real hit-man that happens to be Dennis Hopper . John Dahl has co-written and directed this movie . Therefore it goes to show that a project can turn out decent when a director puts his thoughts on screen . The direction is of good standard , however while watching the movie I got a made for TV movie feeling . There were too many close up frames . However this does not deter the movie from being an enjoyable experience . The movie had good pace and the structure was perfect . Dahl written the script with good duration of lenght . Cage portrayed the role as a drifter realistically , though to me his performance seemed somewhat restrained . His facial expressions were on the mark . Lara Flynn Boyle was hot and handled her part perfectly as the femme fatale . Her hairstyle was far out and can make any guy go on his knees . Hopper played his part well . But I feel he was miscast for this role . He did not convince me that he had the qualities of a hit-man . The role was not written keeping his personality in mind . While viewing one will get deja vu of previous movies like 'The Hot Spot ' and 'A Perfect Murder ' . Due to the fact that some sub plots are similar . Overall if you are a fan of noir movies , then this one is for you . Worth recommending . 7/10
I had never seen a silent movie until July 24 , 2005 . I had never seen a movie with Mary Pickford in it . I 've seen thousands of movies . Very few are hypnotic to me . I found Last of the Mohicans and Unforgettable ( Ray Liotta ) to be hypnotic , so consider the source as you read this . I started watching Tess of the Storm Country on TCM just to see who this Mary Pickford was , who has been credited by many for launching Hollywood . I had no idea what I was in for . Two hours later , I snapped out of it , and realized I 'd watched one of the most beautiful women I had ever seen , playing a role perfectly suited to her . Imagine a movie fan in 1922 , having never seen anyone that gorgeous and that expressive before . You would have to see her again and again . The setting was perfect for a girl that expressive . She was a poor squatter , could n't speak the King 's English , but you had to admire her . What a movie ... time to start my Mary Pickford movie collection !
This is one of my favorite comedies ever . Not wanting to condone the uninspiring lifestyle of its hero , but taken for what it 's worth and not as trivializing alcoholism , the movie is simply a lot of fun . It tells the unlikely tale of a perpetually drunk , irresponsible 40 something bachelor named Arthur who is set to inherit a vast fortune , but only if he marries Susan , chosen because the family thinks she might make something of him . Arthur proposes , but then unwisely falls for Linda , a waitress and petty thief . Dudley Moore is perfect as Arthur , the world 's most endearing drunk , whose antics are a laugh a minute . Admittedly , Moore IS Arthur and I agree with those who can imagine no other actor in the role . The ladies of the piece are also well portrayed . Liza Minnelli sparkles as Linda , and her on screen chemistry with Moore is great . Jill Clayburgh plays Susan , the wealthy and more appropriate woman chosen for Arthur . However , this film is literally made by Sir John Gielgud , who portrays Arthur 's sarcastic but moral butler , Hobson . It 's obvious these two have had a great mutual affection during Hobson 's longtime employment . Hobson is Arthur 's best friend and purveyor of unsolicited commentary and advice . The most interesting relationship in this film is not Arthur 's romance at all , but his unusual rapport with this witty and of course perpetually disapproving servant . It 's the butler you 'll remember best long after the closing credits roll .
The movie was much better than the other reviewer stated . It 's a nice family movie . It has a fun fantasy aspect of some time travel . The story revolves around a 14 year old girl who accidentally finds a way to travel back in time in the old elevator of her apartment building . Of course , no one believes her when she tries to explain her disappearances . She finds and makes friends with a girl about her age and is able to help the girl 's family in many ways . She is also able to help her own relationship with her father in the long run . It reminds me of a Hallmark movie so give it a chance and decide for yourself . It seemed to be aimed more towards children about 6-12 years ( maybe a bit older ) and it 's pretty much PG or G rated . I 'm an adult who can appreciate a nice `` family '' movie - I guess the other reviewer is n't .
Does anyone else cry tears of joy when they watch this film ? I LOVE it ! One of my Top 10 films of all time . It just makes me feel good . I watch the closing production number with all the cast members over and over and over ! ! ! Bebe Benson ( Michelle Johnston ) is THE babe of the film , IMHO ! I never saw the play but I get angry when I read reviews that say the play was better than the film . The two are like apples and oranges . The film making process will seldom deliver a finished product that is faithful to the original work . I believe it 's only due to the fear of public alienation that many well known works adapted to the screen are n't changed more than they are . This is a very good film , it is very satisfying . That 's all you need to know !
I approach films about talking animals with care . For every wonderful one like Babe , you get an equally poor one like the dreadful remake of Homeward Bound : The Incredible Journey . Or in the case of Cats & Dogs , you have a great idea for a film not living up to its potential . When I heard about Paulie , the premise of a wisecracking parrot did n't exactly fill me with confidence . But I found the film a pleasant surprise . And it manages to sneak its way into your heart without you realising . A Russian janitor , Misha Vilyenkov ( Tony Shaloub ) gets a job in a research laboratory . One day , he hears singing coming from the basement . And when he investigates , he finds a parrot in its cage singing its little heart out . Misha becomes fascinated with the bird , especially when it turns out the parrot can not only sing , it can talk . And not a few phrases either . Its a parrot you can actually make conversation with . The parrot is called Paulie ( voiced by Jay Mohr ) , and recognises a fellow castaway in Misha . Wondering how this world to the wise bird ended up in a dusty basement , Misha convinces Paulie to tell him his life story . Which all began when he was a baby , and in the care of Marie , a five year old girl with a stutter . The two of them became birds of a feather ( OK , bad pun ! ) . When Marie 's parents became concerned about her close friendship with a bird , they considered sending him away . And they finally did after Marie nearly injured herself in a fall after teaching Paulie to fly . Desperate to be reunited with her , Paulie begins a long journey across America , which includes a diverse number of new owners , flying great distances , and even ending up behind bars . Of a cage that is ! Paulie was one of a number of talking animal films released by DreamWorks in the late 90s . And although it was n't afforded the same recognition or box-office success of Babe , Paulie succeeds on quite a few levels , and is an occasional work of striking intelligence . Jay Mohr 's stand-up style of acting is well suited to the part of Paulie . He never plays the part as too smug , even if he is a bit of a smart Aleck . Paulie 's worldly , but he is also naive in his way . Because he 's lived a rather sheltered life with Marie , when he 's taken away , he has to fend for himself for the first time . And when he falls into the hands of different owners , they make promises to Paulie to reunite him with Marie , which he believes . Only for those promises to be broken time and again . Paulie is admittedly a little episodic . It follows the eclectic people Paulie ends up with , and how he slowly gets brought closer and closer to Marie . He first winds up in a pawn shop , where he is adopted by Ivy ( Gena Rowlands ) , a kindly woman who teaches him the meaning of manners . She sympathises with Paulie 's situation , and drives an RV across America to find Marie . Paulie is an occasionally very touching film . His scenes with Ivy are some of the best . Wonderful moments of Paulie perched on her shoulder singing Tom Jones numbers . The way she instills in him the need for hope is great , and some of the dialogue is quite well written and even thought-provoking : `` There are things in life you put off , because you think you 're gon na do them later . But the real thing Ivy taught me is you got ta live like there may not be a later . '' The scene where Ivy passes away en route leaving Paulie all alone is a very heart-rending moment . And the sequence where he plucks up the courage to fly for the first time across the Grand Canyon , soaring majestically is such a beautifully composed scene it stays with you for hours after the film 's over . Despite the occasional sad moment , there are plenty of laughs to be had . Paulie falls in with a group of performing parrots at a Spanish outdoor restaurant . The animatronic effects here are really excellent as four birds do a perfectly choreographed dance number . And Paulie even gets to have a romance . Which is dashed when he falls in with a petty thief ( played by Mohr as well ) . That may be the only complaint I have . As soon as you get comfortable with one situation , the film then moves Paulie on to another . The scene where Paulie is taught to steal money from ATM machines is funny , but a little disturbing too . I 'm amazed DreamWorks were granted the chance to include such a scene in a kids film . And Paulie 's diamond robbery is very Mission Impossible . He 's caught in the act , and shipped off to the lab for animal testing , where he 's remained ever since . The story finally comes full circle at the lab , where Misha vows to help Paulie . Of course they do find Marie . But the final revelation is a scene of such shocking intensity , I was left numb for several minutes . Paulie may never get the longevity Babe has , but I believe its an equally brilliant film . The same laughs . The same flawless effects . And the same surprising intelligence . A minor gem .
There 's an inexhaustible hunger for `` basic training '' movies , so it 's surprising that this one got so little notice when first released . Looks likely to have a well-deserved second life on DVD/VHS . Tigerland is n't uniformly great by any means , there are some terribly cliched characters ( especially the portrayal of the NCO 's , makes you long for the return of Lee 'Full Metal Jacket ' Ermey ) but the lead performance of Colin Farrell is the stuff of instant stardom . Charisma to burn and a role any actor would kill to get .
I had first watched this several years ago on a now-defunct Sicilian TV channel ; amazingly , the film emerged as a heftily-priced DVD from Criterion : not being sure what I had made of it initially ( despite having attained cult status over the years , the achievement proper is clearly viewed with modesty even by genre buffs ) , I opted not to make the purchase  as I did with the similar and , to me , unfamiliar FIEND WITHOUT A FACE ( 1958 ) . Recently , however , I managed to acquire THE BLOB via a copy of the Spanish DVD which , interestingly , ported over the two Audio Commentary tracks from the Criterion `` Special Edition '' but , regrettably , I could not switch off the Spanish subtitles during playback of the main feature ! Anyway , looking at the film anew , I was surprised by how much I enjoyed it ( despite many a narrative flaw , which I will get to later )  as a pure example of 'B-movie ' schlockiness ( atypically shot in pleasant color ) and a time-capsule illustrating late 1950s social attitudes . The male lead was an early role for Steve ( n ) McQueen and , though the actor may have subsequently looked at it with disdain , his sole contribution to the genre proves fairly engaging : not averse to juvenile kicks but still essentially a decent ( and , more importantly , altruistic ) kid . The special effects depicting the slimy and expanding creature are not too bad of its kind and period ; the film itself rises to a good climax  beginning with the monster 's invasion of a cinema ( showing DAUGHTER OF HORROR [ 1953/7 ] as I mentioned recently in that film 's review but being curiously screened 'flipped ' and which sequence , incidentally , would be featured at the opening of a satirical Italian program actually called `` Blob '' ! ) . As to the admittedly minor quibbles I have with the film : the monster is not shown traveling  it just turns up at a variety of places , never being seen by anyone ! ; there is a baffling over-emphasis ( tantamount to padding ) on the kids ' scrapes with Police ; it is silly to have the town doctor shoot at The Blob  as if fluid , whatever its proportion , can be destroyed by bullets ! ; equally nonsensical is having the teenagers alert the townsfolk of the danger by making door-to-door visits ( especially when considering that , at that stage , only McQueen had actually seen the monster in action ) ! An inferior sequel emerged in 1972 called BEWARE THE BLOB ! ; the original was then remade in 1988  I watched this not too long ago but it seems not to have made a lasting impression on me ( though I know Micheal Elliott loves it ) . For the record , I will be following this viewing with two more collaborations between director Yeaworth and producer Jack H. Harris , namely 4D MAN ( 1959 ) and DINOSAURUS ! ( 1960 ) .
Acting This film is a very well acted film . I will say that the performances are slightly weak at times ; but for the most part , the acting is very good . The only actor that blew me away with his performance was Jude Law as Harlen Maguire . He was incredible ! Tom Hanks seemed alittle unsure at at a few points throughout the film but he too was incredible . Paul Newman , good as always . Cinematography This is what made the movie a masterpiece ( and I rarely use that word ) . Conrad Hall is a true genius . If at any point in the movie you were to pause it , you will see the delicately crafted work of this man . He sets up every shot so that nothing is left out . When the camera is still , there is a postcard like quality to the screen . When the camera is moving , every shot is planned to understated perfection . But it does n't stop there . Conrads choice of colors and contrast between light and dark settings is a work of art . The way he lights the set is some of the most amazing lighting work I 've seen . His work on this movie made it what it is . This movie is at the top of the list for best Cinematography with LOTR , Black Hawk Down , Hero , CTHD , Moulin Rouge , and Vertigo . Story People will say this movie is a 1930s gangster flick but , I believe they missed the point of the movie . It is a love story about a hit-man who fails in trying to protect his son from the life he chose . It is a brilliantly crafted story that unfolds into a beautiful bond between two people who have nothing but each other . The screen Writing is worthy of an Oscar . Music Thomas Newman conducts a sad but hopeful score to intensify this sad but hopeful story . The music is some of the most beautiful and moving scores I 've herd . Direction Sam Mendes is a new director with a feel of an experienced director . The symbols he uses and the performances he gets from his actors is a rarity in todays film-making world . I will be on the lookout for the next Sam Mendes Film . 10/10 one of the most moving and beautiful movies I 've ever seen .
Well , `` Cube '' ( 1997 ) , Vincenzo 's first movie , was one of the most interesting and tricky ideas that I 've ever seen when talking about movies . They had just one scenery , a bunch of actors and a plot . So , what made it so special were all the effective direction , great dialogs and a bizarre condition that characters had to deal like rats in a labyrinth . His second movie , `` Cypher '' ( 2002 ) , was all about its story , but it was n't so good as `` Cube '' but here are the characters being tested like rats again . `` Nothing '' is something very interesting and gets Vincenzo coming back to his 'Cube days ' , locking the characters once again in a very different space with no time once more playing with the characters like playing with rats in an experience room . But instead of a thriller sci-fi ( even some of the promotional teasers and trailers erroneous seemed like that ) , `` Nothing '' is a loose and light comedy that for sure can be called a modern satire about our society and also about the intolerant world we 're living . Once again Vicenzo amaze us with a great idea into a so small kind of thing . 2 actors and a blinding white scenario , that 's all you got most part of time and you do n't need more than that . While `` Cube '' is a claustrophobic experience and `` Cypher '' confusing , `` Nothing '' is completely the opposite but at the same time also desperate . This movie proves once again that a smart idea means much more than just a millionaire budget . Of course that the movie fails sometimes , but its prime idea means a lot and offsets any flaws . There 's nothing more to be said about this movie because everything is a brilliant surprise and a totally different experience that I had in movies since `` Cube '' .
I was going to give it an 8 , but since you people made 6.5 out of a lot better votes , I had to up my contribution . The river Styx was pure genius . Sure , Woody was his perennial stuff , but at least his role was appropriate . The first half hour was really hilarious , and then the rest of the movie was easy to watch . The dialog was clever enough , and Woody 's card tricks at the parties , along with the reaction from the upper crust , were fun to watch . This was much better than the newspaper critics made it sound out to be . And a plus , a little Sorcerer 's Apprentice to go along with it . And of course , did you notice that Johansen is getting a bit frumpy ? Charles Dance is always entertaining , as was Hugh Jackman .
Vincent Cassel plays the part of Paul , an ex-con assigned to an office job where he meets Carla , a secretary who is quite deaf ' , when she has her hearing aids in very deaf when not ( played by Emmanuelle Devos ) . Together they help each other to develop as people . What was particularly interesting about this film was the complexity of the characters  not fitting into obvious stereotypes . Paul appears uneasy in the office environment , is it that he 's just not cut out for work ? This belief is dispelled when he gets a job in a bar and shines . The film has a certain amorality which I find refreshing and showed how easy is to act criminally , even if we think it is harmless or justified . Finally , it is a film full of great moments ' both touching and humorous . One is when Carla is babysitting and is trying to comfort a screaming baby . She continues to cuddle it  but takes her hearing aids out for her own comfort .
There is so much that can be said about this film . It is not your typical nunsploitation . Of course , there is nudity and sex with nuns , but that is almost incidental to the story . It is set in 15th Century Italy , at the time of the martyrdom of 800 Christians at Otranto . The battle between the Muslims and the Christians takes up a good part of the film . It was interesting when everyone was running from the Muslim hoards , that the mother superior would ask , `` Why do you fear the Muslims , ; they will not do anything that the Christians have done to you ? '' Certainly , there was enough torture on both sides . Sister Flavia ( Florinda Bolkan ) is sent to a convent for defying her father . In the process , she witnesses and endures many things : the gelding of a stallion , the rape of a local woman by a new Duke , the torture of a nun who was overcome during a visit by the Tarantula Sect , and a whipping herself when she ran off with a Jew . The torture was particularly gruesome with hot wax being poured on the nun , and her nipples cut off . Sister Flavia is bound to continue to get into trouble as she questions the male-dominated society in which she lives . She even asks Jesus , why the father , son and holy ghost are all men . Eventually , she joins the leader of the Muslims as his lover and they sack the convent . Here is where you see more flesh than you can possible enjoy at one time . But , tragedy is to come . She manages to exact sweet revenge on all , including the Duke and her father , but finds that the Muslim lover treats her exactly the same . She is a woman and that is all there is to it . I wo n't describe what the holy men of the church did to this heretic at the end , but it predates the torture of Saw or Hostel by decades . Nunsploitation fans will be satisfied with the treats , but movie lovers will find plenty of meat to digest .
I nominate this and BABYLON 5 as the best television sci-fi series made . Both stand out in my mind because unlike early STAR TREK series , there is a consistent evolution of plots and characters . If you look at the original STAR TREK and STAR TREK : TNG , they were fine shows , but there was no overall theme or plot that connected all the episodes . In many ways , you could usually watch the shows totally out of sequence with no difficulty understanding what is occurring . This was less the case with DEEP SPACE 9 ( with its giant battles that took up all of the final season ) and the other TREK shows , as there was more of a larger story that unified them . This coherence seems to have developed as a concept with BABYLON 5 and saw this to an even greater extent with SG-1 . The bottom line is that in many ways this series was like watching a family or a long novel slowly take form . Sure , there were a few `` throwaway '' episodes that were not connected to the rest , but these were very few and far between and were also usually pretty funny . And speaking of funny , I loved that SG-1 kept the mood light from time to time and was n't so dreadfully serious . In this way , I actually enjoyed it more than BABYLON 5 . Jack O'Neill was a great character with his sarcasm and love of Homer Simpson -- it 's really too bad he slowly faded from the series in later seasons . To truly appreciate SG-1 , you should watch it from the beginning and see how intricately the plots work . This coherence gives the show exceptional staying power . And , if you do n't like SG-1 after giving it a fair chance , then sci-fi is probably NOT the genre for you .
Alright , this film is the representation of several things . For starters , this film is about a disgruntled student who brings a gun to school and shoots roughly 9 students . One student survives and is in the hospital with extensive head injuries . The lead character is what several people who consider a 'loner/goth ' , despite the movie 's stating of her not being so . She seems quite mysterious , but was also the only unharmed student in the victimized classroom . She 's questioned , due to having a history of knowing the shooter and having a record of being on the phone with him the night before . Anyhow , she 's a very brief and distant person who seems to despise society . Yet , due to some , at first unexplained events , she spent roughly a year out of school , failing the grade . She has the desire to graduate , and the principle practically cons her into the only possible way she can pass is to spend time with the survivor , the girl in the hospital . These two leads are nearly entirely opposite , and they are quite that on a social level . While Alisha is a quiet , inwardly disturbed , anti-social 'goth ' girl who spends her time entirely alone ( even though she seems to read quite often , somewhat of a closet/out of the closet bookworm ) , the other girl is a rich , popular 'bubbly ' girl who seems always incredibly optimistic and trapped in her own fantasy world , ignoring the outside world and its realism to survive . I feel both of these roles to a marvelous job of representing MOST 'cliques ' in the modern highschool , but more importantly shows how two entirely opposite girls who know nothing of each other eventually open to each other . While the injured girl learns a deep , meaningful truth on her once sheltered life and the outside world , Alisha learns that complete abandonment of society and locking everything inside is not always the best thing . Many people will look to the connection between these two girls and see one of two things . Either , a snobby , hateful girl who wants he rest of the world to suffer as she does , taking it out on an innocent girl , OR the story of a seemingly trapped , fantasized girl who meets an outcast to society and learns not only not to judge , but that she is actually , perhaps , one of the most intelligent people she 's known . In other words , people may see this film as a focus on Alisha teaching the other girl a lesson about life , but it is n't about that . This film is about SEVERAL things . While it is about all I have stated , it is also representative of how people deal from a large , life-changing catastrophe . Truly , this movie is not very symbolic , but instead incredibly straight forward with its message , as long as you are n't afraid to open your mind , and your heart , to some emotions you may not be familiar with being portrayed so miraculously . Overall , this film is one of the best I 've ever seen . The acting is brilliant , the storyline and representation is deep and meaningful , and the emotion flowing through-out this film will have anyone not only relating , but possibly crying . This film is by far heart-wrenching , and very impactful , and if I ever believed any film could alter a person 's life ... this would be the first that could have changed mine . I adored this movie , if you ever want a movie that 's moving and impactful , while incredibly entertaining and REAL , watch this .
What does the Marquis de Sade have to do with Egyptian archaeology and mermaid worshipping cults ? Tobe Hooper tries to answer that question in one weird little film . Genie is a young cutie who visits her nerdy archaeology father in Alexandria , Egypt . Genie gets caught up with a mysterious hooker ( and blatant lesbian ) who services daddy on the side . Daddy gets sent back to the site , where he uncovers a tomb with what appears to be a mermaid on it . Genie meets a descendant of the Marquis de Sade , and falls for a hunky Egyptian ( providing the film 's hottest scenes ) . Eventually , Genie finds out she is to be a sacrifice and the protracted and bloody climax gets going . Wrapped around this story is footage of the Marquis de Sade in prison , talking to a portrait of what looks like Genie . Robert Englund is terrific as both the Marquis and his descendant . His acting abilities have always been sideswiped by his makeup requirements , so he is allowed to shine here . His best performance is still in `` Killer Tongue , '' if you have not seen that yet . The rest of the cast , including young Genie , are pretty and average . The script , however , is problematic . You will quickly learn that the Marquis scenes are completely unnecessary , except maybe the film makers had access to the cool set . The mermaid cult that eventually saves Genie makes no sense whatsoever . Who the mermaid is is never explained , and its link to Christianity ( which is hyped throughout the film ) is nothing . The film is very anti-Christian , as the archaeologist is a Bible spouting father , but likes to be tied up by the local prostitute . There are plenty of scenes of depravity and violence , but Hooper probably had little idea of what the screenwriters were trying to say . I know I have no idea . So why am I recommending this film ? It is weird . There is an extended sex scene . For the ladies , hunky Egyptian rides a horse completely nude . Englund is marvelous . Do you like snakes ? This film is full of them . This is like Roger Corman with a bigger budget . Knowing Hooper somehow came up with `` Crocodile '' after this is rather sad . `` Night Terrors '' is not perfect , but definitely worth a winking , unserious look . This is rated ( R ) for physical violence , some sexual violence , gore , profanity , female nudity , male nudity , sexual content , sexual references , and drug abuse .
Another comment about this film made it sound lousy . Given talking pictures were so new - I think the script and acting were good . Davis was so young and fresh . She had not yet found her own style that we had grown to expect . Yet it is great to see her this way - still learning the craft . So many clichés came from this film and it seems , this film blazed some trails for the next 70 years . My vote is see it and remember how young this type of film was . Keep and open mind and you maybe shocked at how troubled the characters were in this picture , for being 1934 and how we view the early part of last century as uptight.. I love it and hope you make up your own mind about it not influenced by others negative and one note comments .
An enthralling , wonderful look at the films that inspired the excellent Martin Scorsese . Many of the films he speaks of are easy to relate to his works , particularly the earlier ones , the silent era . Very enjoyable despite being a bit long , I found this to be one of the best documentaries on film yet . Required viewing if you admire Martin Scorsese and his work .
This drama is unlike Sex and the City , where the women have a few drinks and share their sexual encounters with each other . Its much more personal and people can relate to it . Its much more engaging and emotional on a new level than other dramas focusing on women and their lives like `` Sex and the City , Lipstick Jungle ... . '' Dr. Katie Roden , is a psychologist with a dark secret , she seems much more depressed and guilt ridden than the rest of her 3 friends . She is dealing with the death of her former lover who was her patient while tackling his son 's advances on her . Her sombre clothes and empty and cold house convey her inside emotions very well . Trudi Malloy , a widow is battling issues with `` letting go '' of her dead husband from 9/11 . And when a handsome stranger , Richard shows an interest in her she is suddenly forced to do a reality check by her friends who suggest that she gets back into dating business . The ridiculous and embarrassing courting scenes between Richard and Trudi are totally funny ! It is interesting to note that Richard asks her out the day she gets a millions from the 9/11 board for her husband 's death..lets see what his intentions are Siobhan Dillon , a lawyer is fed up of her husband 's love making tactics which only involve `` baby making '' ( as they are having trouble conceiving ) and she quickly falls for her colleague who offer his `` services '' a little too willingly to her and she does not hesitate for long ! It will interesting to see whether she will continue her affair or patch up with her husband ( played by Raza Jeffrey ) Jessica , a real estate business woman is single and is straight , until she organizes a lesbian wedding and has an affair with one of them . Her character is shown as a bold and provocative woman who before her lesbian encounter is having sex with a `` married man '' , her colleague . Lets see where her character venture to ... . The beauty of this drama is that we are shown 4 totally different women with different scenarios , whose ambitions and inhibitions are shown . Its also a good thing that the drama reveals the fact that sometimes friends lie to each other to be `` safe '' !
Plato 's run is an entertaining b movie with Gary Busey.it is a fairly unknown film so one i saw it at a car boot i thought this looks entertaining i was right to.Gary Busey plays Plato smith a tough mercenary who is framed for the assassination of a powerful Cuban crime lord now on the run Plato must survive long enough to prove his innocence with the help of his friends played by Steve Bauer ( scarface ) and action star Jeff Speaksman ( the expert ) . what i liked about Plato 's run was the way the film never got boring the plot may have been done before but it was still good the acting was fun to watch and the action was quite fun as well especially the climax Gary Busey makes a good hero ironic since he normally plays the bad guy and Steve Bauer is good as Plato 's sidekick even Jeff Speaksman makes a good performance and he cant even act well to finish it of Plato 's run is an enjoyable effort from nu image films and i give it 7 out of 10
It 's a strange , yet somehow impressive story , about love . Personnaly , I never run over such a twist-off story in real life . But , I can image there is . It 's a story that promises to be `` sick '' from the title . But , after I watch it , I did n't get this feeling of `` sickness '' which I would surely have regarding society rules . It 's something beautiful in this movie ... something impressive ... which I can not contradict using any moral or society rules . The movie focuses mostly on relation between Kiki and Alex . You can see how this relation starts , evolves and finally ends . You feel the moment when this love blossoms , the first whispers , touchings . You feel the connection . And no moment I though this is immoral . You even hope it will not break in the end ... .it can not break ... it 's not right . You feel the pain of being hart broken in the end ... But , I need also to add a negative spin to this comment ... I do n't know if the story is not somehow *showed* to give the feeling that these relations are sick only in form , but not in content . You do n't have the total story , but only fragments . When movie has started , the relation between Kiki and Sandu was already in place . So , no clue about the nature of the relation . You feel only a tension between them ... a fight between the need for love and desire to break this relation . I think this line of Kiki to Sandu says all : `` I want to stop ... and if you love me , you will do as I ask you '' . This movie will probably stir some questions about what is love and what is to be moral ... and where 's the limit between them . I do n't know if the idea of this movie is `` love conquers all ... even social and moral standards '' or `` love is beautiful ... no matter how or where '' . But in my opinion , this movie is already a success for the simple reason that it makes you think ...
I read the book in 5th grade and now a few years later I saw the movie . There are a few differences : 1.Billy was oringinally suppose to eat 15 worms in 15 days , not 10 worms in one day by 7:00pm . 2.Billy is suppose to get 30 dollars after he 's eaten all the worms . In the movie after Billy eats all the worms , Joe has to go to school with worms in his pants . 3 . Joe is suppose to fake some of the worms but in the movie , he does n't at all . Even though there are changes , this movie is still one that kids will enjoy .
I was up late flipping cable channels one night and ran into this movie from about 10 minutes into the start - every time I even thought going to bed , something kept on telling me to keep on watching it even though it was way way way past my bedtime . This movie could have been another easy slam dunk anti-gun film , but instead they chose to examine the aftereffects of the shootings . And even better , the movie kept on with the real life - just when you think they are going to take the easy and obviously contrived way out , a twist comes along and changes the whole outlook of the movie . This film not only does n't follow the formula , it shows how other events often lead up to and/or affect what happens afterwards . I only wish the filmmakers had explored the issues around anti-depressant drugs more - the kids from Columnbine who did the shootings were on them for years and it was frightening to watch the way Deanna popped them every time the nightmares started . Up until recently they were dispensing the stuff like candy and only now do they even begin to understand what long term effects the drugs have . It was very refreshing to see that the mental illness aspect of the story was given quite a bit of film , having a relative who suffers from a mental illness , I can say that the movie was dead nuts on in every aspect of mental illnesses . Bravo to the director and writer who obviously did their homework on those issues . And for those who think certain things could n't happen in a hospital ( I do n't want to tell any particulars ) , you 're dead wrong on that too - I 've been there . The script was so real it was amazing . Go BUY this film and show it to your teenage kids before it 's too late . Someday they 'll thank you for it .
I did n't approach `` Still Crazy '' with any real anticipation . Just another rock'n'roll picture , I figured ... good nostalgia for the baby boomers . This film is partially that , but so much more . Brian Gibson , the director , previously helmed a biography of Tina Turner , and is quite successful in his style . I suppose it is fitting that this was his last film . The cast is well-chosen . Bill Nighy is perfect in his role as the band 's frontman . Actor-turned-director Bruce Robinson appears as the band 's washed-up guitarist . He does a superb job , even though he has n't appeared on film since the late 70 's . If you 're looking for an touching and funny film ( with some great songs ) , you 've found it . 7.4 out of 10
What more can be said ? I have not been this fascinated with a young actress since Cate Blanchett burst upon the scene over ten years ago . And although both Blanchett and Blunt have played Queens now ( seems to be the benchmark for up and coming actresses ) , the roles are complete polar opposites . Simply put if you are looking for high passion , compelling drama , and Machiavellian intrigue , this is not the movie for you . This is n't to say that the script or direction was bad , its just that the subject of the film did not lead too dramatic a life when compared to other notable royals like Elizabeth I , Anne Boylen , Henry VIII , Henry V , Henry II and Elainor of Acquitane . These are people whose lives were the stuff such as good soap operas are made of and whose policies and decisions altered the course of British , and in most cases , world history . Victoria , in contrast , ascended the throne without incident , she quasi-governed a nation that was fast becoming a global power due to industrialization and the rise of the Navy , her State had a stable government led by competent and dynamic politicians , and she married young had a harmonious family life . The facts of her life are not the Sturm und Drag such as powerful dramas are made of . The heart of the film , aside from the attempt to dramatize her stultifying upbringing and the machinations surrounding her throne , is the story of the one thing that was truly shocking and surprising about her reign- a love story . Marriage made for financial or political reasons is with reason not necessarily the place to look for world shaking passion , yet Victoria will always be remembered in history as being sort of a Patron Saint marital fidelity , happiness and ideal family life . Thus , central to the film is the budding love of Victoria and her Prince Albert . I was very taken with Rupert Friend 's characterization of Albert whom he portrayed as a kind , patient , somewhat earnest and maybe a touch naive young man , looking to '' do good in the world and help '' . In short , he is a good man with a good heart , not the most dynamic figure to base a drama around , but as that is not the point of the story , that does not matter . The heart of the character shines through thanks to Friend 's understated yet earnest performance . As for the Queen , well..Emily Blunt is sublime . Her beauty can not be denied , but she is more than something pretty to look at ; her face is like quicksilver because of her expressiveness . The slightest arch of the eyebrow , glance of the eye or slight wry smile delivers so much . Again , this is not a bombastic performance of heavy speeches and impassioned pleas , its not that kind of movie . But what Ms. Blunt does do with the role is show the simple humanity of the character with potent subtlety . For example , we see the joie de vivre that has been kept in check by Victoria 's mother ( Miranda Richardson ) and her scheming adviser/lover Conroy expressed in the simple things like Victoria trying to sketch her dog . We see her delight and fascination upon first meeting Albert by her eyes being continually drawn to him . We see her nervous and overwhelmed when addressing Parliament upon her Ascension . And my favorite scene of all in the film- we see her nervous , happy , and hopeful as she steels herself to do what really most women never have to do in their life- ask the man she loves to marry her , a proposition so ridiculous for those times ( and some would say now ) that Victoria bursts out in nervous laughter before she can even say `` marry me '' . Again , this is not a movie for over the top larger than life expressions , but more a study in the subtleties of a character and making the little things say so much . So , overall , I judge the film by what it is and what it tried to do and as such I give it a 7 . I felt that some of the politics could be better explained and that some very fine actors were wasted with little do and little character development , namely Miranda Richardson as the Duchess of Kent , and the characters of Conroy and Lord Peal . Again , the film need not have spent a large amount of time on those characters , but a little more exposition would have helped to explain the political environment . Also I would have loved to have seen more of the adjustment to married life between Victoria and Albert , but that may be just my greed for more scenes between Friend and Blunt . In summary , do n't view this film in terms of a historical drama but for what it really is , a love story between two characters that happen to be historical figures . I give this film a solid 7 for wonderful lead performances , brilliant costumes and scenery and the magnificent Victoria of Emily Blunt . And anyone who has any shred of romance left in them , you will be touched by the end of this movie . God save the Queen .
Saving Grace is a nice movie to watch in a boring afternoon , when you are looking for something different than the regular scripts and wants to have some fun . I mean , the whole idea of this movie and all the marijuana in it is such a craziness ! It was the first movie I watched with this theme ( drugs/marijuana ) that is not really criticizing it , only making jokes about it . Grace Trevethyn is a widow , who lives in a small town in U.K. and has many financial problems because of her dead husband , who committed suicide since he was full of debts . The problem is that Grace , who imagined to have some money saved for her , discovers that she needs to pay all of her husband 's pounds in debts to not lose all of her things , specially her house that she loves so much . She never worked before , and is in a tragic situation until Matthew , her gardener who is very found of smoking pot , decides to make a partnership with her in selling marijuana in large scale .
This might be the WWE 's 2nd best PPV of the year after Wrestlemania it was a good suprise ! John Cena had an excellent match in which he upset Chris Jericho . Jeff Hardy retained his IC title in a short sloppy match with Willam Regal . Bubba & Spike Dudley won a fairly violent tables match over Benoit & Guerrero . Jamie Noble had a really good match with Kidman which was suprising to me . Booker T defeated The Big Show in a no dq match , at one point Booker T gave the scissors kick to Big Show and sent him right through the table . In a stupid decision by the WWE Christian and Lance Storm , the jealous anti-americans defeated Hogan and Edge with a lot of help from Test and Jericho . RVD and Brock had the match of the night it was filled with great high spots and RVD got to retain his ic title through a DQ so I was happy he kept the title . Triple H also signed with Eric Bischoff and Raw which means little to nothing . And in the main event the Rock became the first ever 7-time WWE world champion defeating both Kurt Angle & Undertaker in a triple threat match . Overall this is probably the WWE 's 2nd best PPV of 2002 ! 7/10
Red Eye starts in Texas where hotel receptionist Lisa Reisert ( Rachel McAdams ) is about to catch the last 'red eye ' flight back to Miami where she lives & works . While waiting for her plane Lisa meets the handsome & charming Jackson Rippner ( Cillian Murphy ) & they both seem to hit it off , then when they board the plane they discover that by a coincidence they are seated next to each other . Once the plane takes off & they are in the air Jackson reveals who he really is & that their seemingly chance meeting was not a coincidence , Jackson says that he is working for someone who wants to assassinate the homeland security secretary Charles Keefe ( Jack Scalia ) & they need her to change his rooms at the hotel where she works in Miami . Jackson tells Lisa to phone the hotel & make it happen or her father will be killed ... Directed by Wes Craven who is perhaps better known for his horror films such as The Last House on the Left ( 1972 ) , A Nightmare on Elm Street ( 1984 ) , The Serpent and the Rainbow ( 1989 ) , The People Under the Stairs ( 1991 ) & the Scream trilogy of teen slashers a short , punchy , fast paced little thriller like Red Eye seems like a big departure from the sort of film Craven usually makes . The script by Carl Ellsworth makes for a surprisingly gripping thriller that I must admit I really enjoyed , at only 85 odd minutes in length it 's a very quick moving , economical & straight to the point sort of film that focuses almost entirely on one tight , taught plot rather than go off in various directions with lots of subplots . Some may like this approach like I did while other 's may not but I think it draws you into the action a lot more as it comes thick & fast without the film slowing down any & giving you a chance to relax . I really liked the plot for Red Eye , sure a film like this is always going to have one or two questionable moments in terms of plotting but what the hell , it 's a film made to entertain & for me that 's what it did . I really liked the two central character 's , Lisa comes across as very likable while Jackson Rippner ( an obvious play on the name of the notorious Victorian serial killer Jack the Ripper ) is a suitably slimy villain with a cold 'I 'm only doing my job ' type mentality . Another plus point is that I did n't think anyone behaved overly stupid here , everyone actually seemed like human beings & the films plays out in a relatively plausible fashion . I really liked this & it 's one of Craven 's better more recent films . Craven turns in a good solid tense , tight , taught & fast paced thriller with an attractive cast , some good action & a gripping plot . He certainly does n't hang about & once he starts the action & tension he never lets up , far & away the most effective part of the film is when Rippner is holding Lisa hostage on the plane & once the film switches to Miami & Lisa 's fathers house it does become a little bit more routine but it 's still good . A special mention goes to Rachel McAdams who is absolutely gorgeous in this , I could probably watch Red Eye again just because she is in it & looks drop dead stunning . Those who see Wes Craven 's name attached to Red Eye expecting a horror film should think again since there 's no horror in it at all ( despite the IMDb listing 'Horror ' as Red Eye 's genre ) . I am not sure about the ending , on the one hand it was nice to see the villain live for a change which goes against traditional expectation but it might have been more satisfying to see Lisa kill him in some way . DreamWorks apparently gave Red Eye an initial budget of $ 44,000,000 but reduced it to $ 25,000,000 although it 's still a very well made film with glossy production values . Actually shot in Los Angeles & Florida in California . The film was supposedly written with husband & wife Sean Penn & Robin Wright Penn intended for the leads but eventually the makers opted for younger leads . As I have already said Rachel McAdams is pure eye candy & is a total babe in this & worth watching the film for on her own . Oh , & she puts in a decent performance too . Red Eye is a really fast paced taught tension filled little thriller that I enjoyed immensely , I did n't think I would enjoy it as much as I did & I am glad I decided to watch it . This definitely gets a recommendation from me & Rachel McAdams really is hot stuff in this ...
Gung Ho is one of those movies that I never get tired of watching . Michael Keaton has always been a favorite of mine , & he is absolutely hilarious in this movie . Matching him step for step is Gedde Watanabe . The two of them work wonderfully together . Although this movie is a comedy , I also like how it shows Hunt ( Keaton ) & Kazihiro ( Watanabe ) struggling in their roles as the leaders of their respective groups . They both try so hard to keep the peace , & then they finally get into a fight ( which is hysterical to watch ) . First , they 're both on the floor . Then Hunt jumps on a chair . Kazihiro jumps on the desk . Hunt jumps on the desk with him . The fight then spills out from the office into the factory . I love that after they are separated by the workers , you can tell that they both feel bad for letting things get so out of hand . Also , there is a scene where you can see the influence that Hunt has had on Kazihiro . He is at his house & his boss from Japan arrives & says he would like to visit the factory tomorrow : Kazihiro : Tomorrow not good day . Sakamoto : Why not ? Kazihiro : Factory is locked & we ca n't find key . Tell me you ca n't picture Michael Keaton saying something like that ! I guess I really like this movie because it is genuinely funny , & also shows how people that are radically different can not only learn from each other , but become good friends as well .
This is , without a shadow of a doubt , one of the scariest and most intriguing episodes of Doctor Who . This is a thrilling psychological ride and you will probably find your own beliefs being thrown into question . Riddled with spine-chilling moments , this is an episode no `` Who '' fan can afford to miss . Starting from when the pit was opened after the events in `` The Impossible Planet '' , the Doctor and Ida are trapped and are running out of air . With no other alternatives , they decide to find what lies at the bottom of the pit , an event which surpasses even The Doctor 's expectations . Whilst there , the Doctor is forced to make what he considers to be the ultimate sacrifice ... Meanwhile , Rose and the other members of the Planet try to find a way to fend off the Ood , whose minds have been poisoned by the Beast . Also , is Toby Zed truly cured of his possession by the Beast ?
At first I was n't sure if I wanted to watch this movie when it came up on my guide so I looked it up on IMDb and thought the cover looked pretty cool so I thought I would give it a try expecting a movie like Elephant . Once I got past the fact that I am supposed to dislike the Alicia character played excellently by Busy Phillips , I realized what a good job this movie was doing toward setting up the relationship between Alicia and Deanna . Alicia is so mean to Deanna played by Erika Christensen almost throughout the entire movie but we eventually find out that they despite being polar opposites they have one thing in common besides being present at the shooting . They share loneliness and to what extent is revealed as the film progresses . I 've just got to say how much I loved this movie and was glad to see all of the positive comments about it . I could n't even get through Elephant because it just seemed to be exploiting the Columbine tragedy . This movie on the other hand was compelling and realistic . Busy Phillips acting is OFF the CHAIN ! ! ! That is a good thing and I would love to see her progress into some more mature roles .
The basic storyline here is , Aditiya ( Kumar ) is the spoilt son of a millionaire , Ishwar ( Bachan ) who owns a toy industry , in Ishwar 's eyes his son Aditya can do nothing wrong , Aditya 's mother Sumitra ( Shefali Shah ) warns Ishwar to bring his son to the responsible path before it is too late , for Ishwar is a patient of lung cancer and has only 9 months to live , when his son elopes and marries Mitali ( Chopra ) , Ishwar readily forgives Aditya , but when the happy couple Aditya and Mitali come back from a honeymoon , Mitali is pregnant , and this forces Ishwar to kick Aditya out of the house to make him more responsible , Aditya does n't know his father is suffering from lung cancer , and he also does n't know that his father has kicked him out of the hose to make him more responsible , Ishwar can not bring himself to tall Aditya that he is about to die , with a hungry and pregnant wife . it is a race against time so Aditya does all he can to prove himself to his father , and the climax comes when Aditya gets his big break in the movie industry and his father tells him that he is about to die . This movie is absolutely brilliant , this is the breakthrough in Indian cinema that was needed for the Bollywood industry , Shah 's directing is almost flawless , but which movie does n't have flaws ? The best part if this movie is the father son relationship which is a tearjerker . the song interludes is just placed at the right time , the scenery is good , the only part where this movie fails is where the jokes between Boman Irani and Rajpal Yadav the jokes are too long and after a bit they are annoying , but overall this is a brilliant movie , i advise anybody Reading this review to go and watch it regardless of other reviews . 9/10
'Panic in the Streets ( 1950 ) ' owes more to British noir that its American counterparts . Like Reed 's 'The Third Man ( 1949 ) ' and Dassin 's 'Night and the City ( 1950 ) , ' director Elia Kazan chose to film largely on location , capturing the fresh and vibrant decadence of the New Orleans slums . In a decision borrowed from the masters of Italian neorealism , he also hired many non-professional actors for minor roles , lending an air of authenticity to the cityscape . However , any further comparisons with neorealism would be misguided , for 'Panic in the Streets ' is pure melodrama , of the best kind . A murdered illegal immigrant , fished out of the bay , is found to be infected with pneumonic plague , a deadly air-borne mutation of bubonic plague , which is transmitted from human-to-human and , untreated , has a mortality rate that approaches 100 % . Clinton Reed ( Richard Widmark ) , an officer with the U.S. Public Health Service , convinces the doubtful police-chief ( Paul Douglas ) to undertake a city-wide manhunt for the men responsible for the homicide , lest they also be infected with the illness . In my younger years , I found Wolfgang Petersen 's 'Outbreak ( 1995 ) ' to be among the most horrifying movies I 'd ever seen . That thriller , which owes plenty to 'Panic in the Streets ' { working title : `` Outbreak '' } , terrified me so efficiently because it depicted the ebola virus as both an invisible and invincible killer  how does one defend themselves against such a thing ? Kazan 's film is the first ( that I know of ) to approach the subject of biological epidemics , though it has difficulty ascribing visual recognition to an enemy that is basically undetectable to the human eye ; it instead uses Jack Palance as a human personification of the Plague . Despite his venturing out among the filthy dregs of human society , you never get the sense that Clinton Reed is placing his own life at risk { some viewers have noted that Reed never inoculated himself against the plague , though I think it 's safe to assume that he did so at the same time as the morgue staff } . Nevertheless , there 's still a strong sense of urgency in the hunt for the infected man 's killers , underground street-rats who pollute the sewers with their misdeeds . In medieval times , when the Black Death ( now widely believed to have been bubonic plague ) swept across the civilised world , killing a third of Europe 's population , many identified the destruction as being the work of the Devil . Jack Palance 's character , Blackie , serves effectively as Satan in human form : the angular-jawed thug can occasionally be charming and charismatic , but is always liable to explode into fits of violence ; his two hoodlums ( played by Guy Thomajan and Zero Mostel ) , through terror more than anything else , are constantly grovelling at his feet . When one lackey falls ill with fever , Blackie deduces that the man 's immigrant cousin must have `` brought something in with him '' ( the irony of his conclusion not passing unnoticed ) , and so attempts to ascertain what this presumably valuable object must be . He cradles the dying Poldi in his arms , a grotesque display of faux affection that is both pathetic and unsettling . Blackie/Satan is finally stopped  not by the authorities , but by the burden of his own infection/evil  as he attempts to board a cargo ship , the primary vessel by which the Plague spread across Europe .
This is one of the best of the genre . I saw it twice about 25yrs ago and have not had another opportunity to see it again since then . It rivals the Zatoichi series ( also starring Katsu ) in exciting swordplay .
Really ... and incredible film that though is n't very popular ... extremely touching and almost life altering ... was for me at least . Definitely worth seeing and buying ... ..Added to my favorite movie list ... .it 's number one now ... . This is a very touching movie that all people should see.. The Man in the Moon ... ..we 'll it 's just incredible . It 's now my favorite movie and I only saw it today and I 'd recommend it to anyone above 15 as long as you 're somewhat mature ... ... If you do n't really try to feel the characters emotions then you 'll never get the true meaning and value of this movie ... .But it really is incredible ... .just watch it because it 'll alter the way some people look at life ... .worth seeing 5/5
I 'm too old to know ( or care ) exactly what the difference between rap and hip-hop is . And , being Canadian , it 's likely that I 've never actually seen MTV , but I 'm not certain . But I thought this film was very funny when I saw it , a bright little satire . Hip-hop culture is so pervasive these days that it 's difficult not to keep hearing about it over and over . ( If only we could say the same about bagpipe music . ) I got most of the jokes ( at least I think I did ) . Sure , it 's derived from Spinal Tap , but there are lots of targets that could stand a Tap treatment . Just not the Carpenters , they 're sacred .
Fabulous film ! Rented the DVD recently and was floored by this stunning piece of work . Douglas Sirk was a filmmaking genius and he gets performances out of Rock Hudson , Dorothy Malone ( Oscar winner ) , Robert Stack ( Oscar nominated ) , and Lauren Bacall that words can not describe . Paul Verhoeven brilliantly payed homage to this film by having Dorothy Malone play Sharon Stone 's murdering inspirational guru in his Basic Instinct . What a great joke ! By turns the film is hilarious , riveting , campy , biting , trashy , compelling , and eye rolling ! It 's definately the grandaddy of every tawdry big-and-little screen soap opera but none have had the dazzling style like you 'll see here : the camera work is smooth and polished , the use of color is breathtaking , the opening montage set to the title song is beyond memorable , the one dimensional characters are unforgettable , and the final image will have you scratching your head as to how the censors back then let it make the final cut ! While most older , highly regarded films can sometimes be a boring chore to sit through , Written on the Wind contains so much and goes by so fast that it 's actually a shame when it ends . Thank you to Mr. Sirk for crafting -and Todd Haynes for drawing attention to- what has now become one of my favorite films of all time ! SEE THIS MOVIE ! ! !
Atlantis was much better than I had anticipated . In some ways it had a better story than come of the other films aimed at a higher age . Although this film did demand a soid attention span at times . It was a great film for all ages . I noticed some of the younger audience expected a comedy but got an adventure . I think everyone is tired of an endless parade of extreme parodies . A lot of these kids have seen nothing but parodies . After a short time everyone seemed very intensely watching Atlantis .
I started to watch this movie expecting nothing , just another movie to watch , but since the first twenty minutes , the artwork and main character , who is enigmatic , does n't talk much , really got me in this movie . I really liked this movie , it was dark , beautifully acted and really touching . It 's a bit slow but the immersion was complete . The directing was awesome by letting us know bits by bits the story leading to the conviction of Joey and his life behind bars . The music was really great and very well incorporated into the scenes . The ending was unexpected with a twist I did n't see coming . It 's not the kind of movie we see often .
I had the privilege of watching Scarface on the big screen with its beautifully restored 35mm print in honor of the 20th anniversary of the films release . It was great to see this on the big screen as so much of it is lost on television sets and the overall largesse of this project can not be emphasized enough . Scarface is the remake of a classic rags to riches to the depths of hell story featuring Al Pacino as Cuban drug lord Tony Montana . In this version , Tony comes to America during the Cuban boat people immigration wave in the late 1970s , early 1980s . Tony and his cohorts quickly get green cards by offing a political figure in Tent City and after a brief stay at a Cuban restaurant ; Tony is launched on his horrific path to towards total destruction . Many of the characters in this movie a played in such skilled manner that is so enjoyable to watch I have forgot little of this film over the last twenty years . Robert Loggia as Tony 's patron , Frank Lopez is wonderful . His character is flawed by being too trusting , and as Tony quickly figures out , soft . Lopez 's right hand , Omar Suarez is portrayed by one of our greatest actors , F. Murray Abraham ( Amadeus . ) Suarez is the ultimate toady and will do anything for Frank ; it is like he does not have a mind of his own . Tony quickly sees this and he constantly battles with Suarez , but really only sees him as a minor problem to get through on his way to the top . The character that always comes back to me as being played so perfectly is Mel Bernstein , the audaciously corrupt Miami Narcotics detective played by Harris Yulin ( Training Day . ) Mel , without guilt extorts great sums of money form all sides of the drug industry . He plays Tony off of Frank until it catches up with him in a scene that marks the exit from the film of both Frank and Mel . It is priceless to hear Frank asking for Mel to intercede , as Tony is about to kill him only to hear Mel reply , ` It 's your tree Frank , you 're sitting in it . ' This is from the man who Frank had been paying for protection ! Tony 's rise is meteoric and is only matched in speed and intensity by his quick crash and burn . After offing Frank and taking his wife and business Tony 's greed takes over and he never can seem to get enough . As Tony plunges deeper into the world of drugs , greed and the inability to trust he eventually kills his best friend and his sister who had fallen in love and married . This all sets up the ending in which Tony 's compound is stormed by an army from his supplier who feels betrayed because Tony would not go through with a political assassination that was ordered . This all stems form a compassionate moment when Tony refused to be an accomplice in a murder that would have involved the victim 's wife and children . All in all this is a great depiction of 1980s excess and cocaine culture . DePalma does a nice job of holding it all together in one of the fastest moving three hour movies around . The violence is extremely graphic and contains a few scenes that will be forever etched on any viewers mind , particularly the gruesome chainsaw seen , the two point blank shots to the head and the entire bloody melee that ends the movie . This is a highly recommended stylistically done film that is not for the squeamish , or for those who need upbeat endings and potential sequels ; DePalma let it all fly right here .
I am amazed that movies like this can still be made . I watch all kinds of movies all the time with my friends and i can say that this is one of the best i ever seen . Never thinked that a movie of 146 minutes can make me think about it on and on . Washington , charismatic and intense as ever , plays Creasy , a washed-up ex-counter-terrorist agent who 's taken to the bottle . Once he 's assigned to protect young Pita ( Dakota Fanning ) in Mexico City , his emotional and redemptive arc is jump-started in the way only an adorable little girl can provide . Inevitably , Pita is kidnapped by thugs , and Creasy decides that most of Mexico City must pay the price for daring to take away his character 's teddy-bear-clutching catalyst . Yes , he has become ... a Man on Fire . You must see this movie .
BEWARE SPOILERS . This movie was okay . Goldie Hawn and Chris Sarandon were the best two in it . Okay , so the goofie foreign guy who ( SPOILER HERE ) trades with the biker for his clothes was funny . This guy 's boss was good , too . But the movie really belonged to Sarandon and Hawn . These two should have had a lot more time on screen together . They 're chemistry was great . The bathroom scene-WOW ! Romantic , sweet , yummy . Hawn is a goofy cocktail waitress who saves a foreign man and ends up at the whitehouse in the middle of a plot due to the greed of politicians . To talk about Sarandon would be to give a lot away . SPOILERS This is a rather untypical romantic/political comedy , and it satisfies both somewhat-the political side a whole lot more than the romantic . It touches on political issues , and just barely skims on romantic areas .
When we started watching this series on cable , I had no idea how addictive it would be . Even when you hate a character , you hold back because they are so beautifully developed , you can almost understand why they react to frustration , fear , greed or temptation the way they do . It 's almost as if the viewer is experiencing one of Christopher 's learning curves . I ca n't understand why Adriana would put up with Christopher 's abuse of her , verbally , physically and emotionally , but I just have to read the newspaper to see how many women can and do tolerate such behavior . Carmella has a dream house , endless supply of expensive things , but I 'm sure she would give it up for a loving and faithful husband - or maybe not . That 's why I watch . It does n't matter how many times you watch an episode , you can find something you missed the first five times . We even watch episodes out of sequence ( watch season 1 on late night with commercials but all the language , A & E with language censored , reruns on the Movie Network ) - whenever they 're on , we 're there . We 've been totally spoiled now . I also love the Malaprop 's . `` An albacore around my neck '' is my favorite of Johnny Boy . When these jewels have entered our family vocabulary , it is a sign that I should get a life . I will when the series ends , and I have collected all the DVD 's , and put the collection in my will .
I really enjoyed this debut by Ring director , Hideo Nakata . If you 've seen Ring beforehand then you 'll be familiar with the style and idea of this flick . It 's got a subtle spookiness about it that works better than the constant ( and predictable ) stingers that infest most mainstream movies of this genre . If you like films that give you the chills , then you will probably like this one . A good , creepy debut by Hideo Nakata . 8/10
My boyfriend and I both enjoyed this film very much . The viewer is swept away from modern life into old Japan , while at the same time exposed to very current themes . The characters are realistic and detailed ; it has an unpredictable ending and story , which is very refreshing . The story is made up of mini-plots within the life of several geisha living together in a poor city district . I highly recommend this movie to anyone who is interested in a realistic romance or life in old Japan .
Murder in Mesopotamia , I have always considered one of the better Poirot books , as it is very creepy and has an ingenious ending . There is no doubt that the TV adaptation is visually striking , with some lovely photography and a very haunting music score . As always David Suchet is impeccable as Hercule Poirot , the comedic highlight of the episode being Poirot 's battle with a mosquito in the middle of the night , and Hugh Fraser is good as the rather naive Captain Hastings . The remainder of the cast turn in decent performances , but are careful not to overshadow the two leads , a danger in some Christie adaptations . Some of the episode was quite creepy , a juxtaposition of an episode as tragic as Five Little Pigs , an episode that I enjoyed a lot more than this one . What made it creepy in particular , putting aside the music was when Louise Leidner sees the ghostly face through the window . About the adaptation , it was fairly faithful to the book , but I will say that there were three things I did n't like . The main problem was the pacing , it is rather slow , and there are some scenes where very little happens . I did n't like the fact also that they made Joseph Mercado a murderer . In the book , I see him as a rather nervous character , but the intervention of the idea of making him a murderer , and under-developing that , made him a less appealing character , though I am glad they did n't miss his drug addiction . ( I also noticed that the writers left out the fact that Mrs Mercado in the book falls into hysteria when she believes she is the murderer 's next victim . ) The other thing that was n't so impressive was that I felt that it may have been more effective if the adaptation had been in the viewpoint of Amy Leatheran , like it was in the book , Amy somehow seemed less sensitive in the adaptation . On the whole , despite some misjudgements on the writers ' behalf , I liked Murder in Mesopotamia . 7/10 Bethany Cox .
Some time in the late 19th century , somewhere in the American West , several cowboys in need of money go on a buffalo hunt . The group 's leader believes that buffaloes are too numerous for the hunting to have any impact , but the more experienced hunter has seen how quickly the population can collapse , and he is n't so sure . Featuring buffalo herds living in South Dakota and showing film of actual hunting ( the movie 's introduction explains it as necessary thinning of the herd ) , the movie does an excellent job of presenting us with the plight of the buffalo and its effect on Native Americans without ever getting preachy about it . The real story , however , is about the dysfunctional family which is created by the small group formed to do the hunting . The father figure is Charlie , a violent man with a short fuse . Sandy , his `` brother '' , is the experienced hunter who is tired of killing but needs the job after losing his cattle . A half-Indian boy , who hates the fact that he looks entirely Caucasian , takes the role of adopted son . The grandfather ( and moral compass ) is an alcoholic buffalo skinner ; Charlie 's `` wife '' is an Indian woman whose companions he killed after they stole his horses . Charlie is clearly the most interesting figure . He is mean and insulting towards everyone around him , yet at the same time he knows that they are the only family and friends that he has . He expects the abducted Indian women to hate him , then accept him , but he does n't know how to react when she refuses to do either . He 's the one who put the family together in the first place , but he 's also the one who is fated to ultimately destroy it . This is all very similar to the classic `` Red River '' , which also features a family of sorts being torn apart by the increasingly violent and alienated father figure . As one might expect , this movie suffers by comparison . The plot is not as focused on developing the characters and family dynamics , and the direction fails to keep all of the scenes working towards this common goal . Charlie is so thoroughly unlikable from the very beginning that we never have any reason to care about what happens to him or his family . On the positive side , however , the message surrounding the buffalo slaughter adds an extra dimension to the film and its conclusion is far superior to the Hollywood ending which was tacked on to the end of `` Red River '' . As a result , `` The Last Hunt '' is an interesting and entertaining film , very well made , but falling short of what would be needed to consider it a classic .
Visual creative epic of inimitable style . This film may neither have the most alternative dramaturgy nor the most artistic acting . But who dares to say this film is no art ? I 'm not a supporter of the idea , that an important film must be serious , non-commercial or bothering me with questions . Even there are a lot of films , apposite to this attributes , that I like . Bogus Journey , for sure , is not one of this films . What you get is pure , excessive creativity with a very positive charged , childlike energy . This film does n't reflect reality . Its friendly-naive and utopian . Imagine the world of the future described by Rufus - for me it would be a pretty nice time-place combination to live in ! Except of that music ; - ) Technically , Bogus Jorney is very well made . I always liked the cinematography and the sceneries of this movie . Especially in this point Bogus Journey tops its prequel by far . Also the effects are good , and I think most of them very made without cgi . I generally prefer the good old effects in big budget movies . Sure its 'just another Hollywood movie ' out of some peoples view . But I think it is this in a very charismatic way . A short word to the soundtrack : all the band and orchestral music fits very well into the film . Also the sound design has no lack . I am not a big fan of rock music , but I had to get this track by Winger from the scene 'station ' builds the bill and ted robots in the van . I love the unorthodox camera work at its beginning . Let me conclude saying this : This film is very naive and very imaginative ! It is way better than Panzerkreuzer Potemkin , The Godfather , Eraserhead or Aguirre - the wrath of god . It is absolutely superior to citizen kane , apocalypse now or chris markers sans soleil ... ... it is even better than Total Recall ... No way ! ? Yes way ! Bill and Ted 's Bogus Journey is simply the best movie ever made . Who dares to disagree makes himself guilty of `` artsie-fartsy behavior '' or likes Terminator Salvation ( what is the bigger self-defamation ) PS : part 1 is not the better movie . So Bogus Jorney is a superior sequel . Not even Terminator 2 is a superior sequel ! Its NOT !
WWE Armageddon , December 17 , 2006 -- Live from Richmond Coliseum , Richmond , VA Kane vs. MVP in an Inferno match : So this is the fourth ever inferno match in the WWE and it is Kane vs. MVP ( wonder why was it the first match on the card ) . I only viewed the ending parts where Kane sets MVP 's ass on fire as they 're on the apron and then MVP is running around the arena while yelling  eventually the refs put out the fire with a fire extinguisher as MVP sprawls around the entrance ramp . Funny and visually quite entertaining ending . 7/10 WWE Tag Team Championship : This was originally supposed to be William Regal & Dave Taylor vs. Brian Kendrick & Paul London ( c ) in a regular tag team match . However , GM Teddy Long comes to the ring and announces that it 's going to be a Fatal 4-way tag team ladder match . MNM and The Hardys are thrown in and it 's all chaos . One word to describe this eye-opener  wow . Man , I really ca n't remember how many sick spots there were in this match and words ca n't really do it justice . There was one particularly notable spot where The Hardys set up a ladder in a see-saw position and Jeff jumped off the top rope while Matt held MNM for the kill , and then WHAM ! Nitro blew away while Mercury apparently botched it and was bleeding like hell with lacerations over his face . He had to be taken away and Nitro continued the match alone . Another spot was when Jeff powerbombed London while FLIPPING off the ladder . There were other high-flying breathtaking spots too many to remember . London finally unbuckles the belts to win this rave show-stealer . 8.5/10 The Boogeyman vs . The Miz : The two men get thrown in and around the ring until Boogeyman explodes a sit-out powerbomb for the victory and then and drools worms over The Miz 's mouth as usual . 5.5/10 for this three-minute incognito . United States championship : Chris Benoit ( c ) faces off Chavo Guerrero in yet another typical Guerrero match . Some good spots included a superplex off the top rope by Chavo and an unusually long chain of German suplexes by Benoit . Vicki Guerrero comes in the ring with the belt to nail Benoit but Benoit scares her off and takes a long time deciding whether to put her in a Sharpshooter or not . This allows Chavo to go for a roll-up but Benoit rolls it up once more and Chavo is locked in the Sharpshooter . Game over . Nice hard-fought battle albeit slow at times . 7/10 WWE Cruiserweight championship : Gregory Helms ( c ) vs. Jimmy Wang Yang for this one , in a fairly moderate-paced match . The match had some good high-flying spots  most notably Helms ' moves off the top rope  but the crowd did n't seem to be into it after witnessing the ladder match , and Yang needs to get more airborne . Helms won the match after blowing Yang away with a facebuster on the knee . 7.5/10 The Undertaker vs. Mr. Kennedy in a Last Ride match : After a series of matches between these two , this time it is a Last Ride match , the second ever of its kind and the winner has to escort his opponent out of the arena in a hearse . Pretty good indeed for what these two could offer . Kennedy manhandled a good deal of Taker and even broke free of a chokeslam to throw Taker off the Armageddon set about 15 feet below ; and thank God for Kennedy , otherwise it would 've been brutal . Kennedy almost got the win until Taker got back up inside the hearse ( I liked the camera view inside the hearse ) . Taker then missed a steel pipe hurl on Kennedy and broke the hearse 's window instead , but then later busted Kennedy open with a chair , and followed with a consecutive chokeslam and Tombstone on the hearse 's roof . Kennedy was unconscious and Taker drove him out of the arena to win . I actually found myself really interested into these guys ' willingness to take/give real sick shots . 7.5/10 Santa comes into the ring , I go `` what the hell ? '' like many of the kids in the crowd , and then the word `` lingerie contest '' gets in my ear . Break time . Batista & John Cena vs. Finlay & King Booker : talk about charisma vs. technicality . This match was actually a quite good main event with the momentum rationally shifting from one team to the other and retaining good suspense . Even Finlay got some legitimate good shots on his opponents this time ( I kind of doubted his strength against the champs ) , and him and Booker mainly did n't succeed in trying to cheat  except at one point where Booker rammed his scepter into Cena 's throat . Batista hits the Bomb on Booker for the win , did n't get to see the F-U ; Cena performed the 5 Knuckle Shuffle anyhow and I think he also did the STFU . This was probably the best technical match of the night and the participants did superbly indeed for what they could without a ladder 7.5/10 . Being an on-and-off WWE fan , I have to agree that Armageddon was laced up with numerous eye-catchers throughout , and the ladder match ultimately swallowed half of the show ; the Last Ride match featured some fairly nerve-wrenching spots , and the main event also did very well for its category . All other matches also lived up to their billing except perhaps the Boogeyman vs . The Miz bout and the ever-useless lingerie contest . Overall Armageddon was a highly enjoyable pay-per-view and despite some big setbacks earlier in the PPV chronology , Armageddon wishes this year 's goodbye respectably . PPV rating : 8/10 .
I admit I have a weakness for alternate history stories , from ITS A WONDERFUL LIFE to GROUNDHOG DAY to 12:01 . Among those greats is this little gem . It 's pretty difficult to get through MR. DESTINY without giving a nod of appreciation to each and every cast member , from the goodhearted James Belushi to the murderous Courtney Cox . This movie lacks the gravitas and scale to make it a great film , but it 's a fine cheer-up on a rainy afternoon . It 's also a great rental for an inexpensive date .
Talk about a blast opening , `` Trampa Infernal '' has the coolest opening credits ever ! Guided by musical tones that are perhaps slightly inspired by the legendary `` Friday the 13th '' theme ( Tsh-Tsh-Tsh-Ha-Ha-Ha ) , the names of the lead players appear on screen split up in giant syllables . Promising intro of a totally obscure Mexican slasher/backwoods survival thriller and it only becomes cooler with every minute that passes . Two extremely competitive and testosterone-overloaded paintball enemies challenge each other to the ultimate showdown in a sleazy bar . According to a newspaper article , there 's a savage bear loose in the nearby woods and it already killed multiple of the hunters that tried to catch it . The challenge includes that whoever kills the bear will be declared the ultimate macho hero with the biggest set of balls . Upon arrival , however , it quickly becomes obvious they 're not up against a bear but a bewildered and utterly maniacal war veteran with quite an arsenal of weapons in his hideout and numerous combat tricks up his sleeve . After a whole decade of tame and derivative American slashers , this early 90 's Mexican effort looks and feels very refreshing and vivid . The formula is simplistic but efficient , the lead characters are plausible enough and the building up towards the confrontations with the sadist killer is reasonably suspenseful . The maniac must have been a fan of Freddy Krueger and Michael Myers , as he also uses a self-made glove with sharp knives attached to it and a white mask to cover his face . The murders are pleasingly nasty and barbaric , which I was really hoping for since the awesome aforementioned opening sequences , and waste a whole lot of gratuitous blood . The forestry setting and particularly the camouflaged booby traps are joyously spectacular . `` Trampa Internal '' is a Mexican slasher/survival sleeper hit that comes warmly recommended to the fans of the genre .
This is a more interesting than usual porn movie , because it is a fantasy adventure.The production values are high and the acting is ( believe it or not ) pretty good , especially Jenna Jameson.It ` s also in widescreen which helps , it gives a feeling of a real motion picture and NOT a porn movie.But , of course it is a porn and a really good one with nice costumes , fine atmosphere and scenery.And by the way , the sex IS hot . Watch out for this one ...
Another very good Mann flick thanks to the father/son combination of Walter Brennan and Jimmy Stewart . Brennan ( Ben Tatum ) is often the comedic conscience of either Stewart or Wayne ( Red River/ Rio Bravo ) . He 's there to see that the younger man takes the ride fork or bend . `` You 're wrong Mr. Dunston '' . Jeff Webster ( Stewart ) gives off the impression he cares only for himself but it is clear he can not desert Brennan . John McIntire is excellent as the law of Skagway with due respect for the trappings of justice over the reality of it . Another key theme is helping people and in turn being helped by people . The loner can do neither and suffers for it . The caption above plays on Tatum 's assertion that he ca n't live without his coffee . This nicotine addiction proves fatal . Probably the first and last time on the screen . I recommend this film and now own the DVD .
Anna ( Charlotte Burke ) , who is just on the verge of puberty , begins to have strange dreams which start affecting her in real life -- especially involving a boy named Mark ( Elliott Spiers ) who she meets in her dreams . Very unusual fantasy with some truly terrifying moments . Despite the fact that this is about a teenage girl and has a PG-13 rating , this is NOT for children . Also , if you hate fantasies stay far away . But if you 're game for something different this fits the bill . Well directed by Bernard Rose with a just beautiful music score and a few nice , scary jolts . The only thing that prevents this from being a really great movie is Burke -- she 's not a very good actress ( it 's no surprise that this has been her only film ) and it hurts the movie . However , everybody else is just great . Spiers is very good as Mark ; Glenne Headley ( faking a British accent very well ) is also very good as Anna 's mother and Ben Cross is both frightening and sympathetic as Anna 's father . A sleeper hit when released in 1988 , it 's since faded away . That 's too bad -- it 's really very good .
Refreshing ` lost ' gem ! Featuring effective dialog combined with excellent acting to establish the characters and involve you enough to care what happens to them . The Douglas and Widmark characters are realistic heroes . Palance is his usual evil presence . Widmark win the fisticuffs fight scene , a car chase of less than 60 seconds with a ` logical ' end , and a lengthy chase on foot that shames the overdone chase sequences of contemporary Hollywood . You know how it will likely end , but the suspense and interest are sustained throughout . The end of the chase is one of the most realistic you will ever see . The film seems to slow a little past the middle , but stay with it for the rewarding conclusion .
Goebbels motivation in backing down was not explored . In the aftermath of Stalingrad the Reich had decided to go for 'total war ' . This is referred to in the film . Part of this was to use women in the war effort , which Germany had not previously done to any great extent . An SS massacre of women would have faced Goebbels with a public relations disaster of massive proportion . His preference was to make the problem go away as quietly as possible , on the basis that the Jewish men could always be rounded up later . I understand the majority survived the war . His other problem was that the 'Red ' Berlin had never been very enthusiastically behind the Nazi cause and had to be handled cautiously . Again a massacre of women could have cost the Nazis what mediocre level of support they had in their capital city . It was interesting that the majority of SS uniforms showed patches which indicated that the men wearing them were not of German nationality , but were from German origins in other countries such as Lithuania or Latvia
Often laugh out loud funny play on sex , family , and the classes in Beverly Hills milks more laughs out of the zip code than it 's seen since the days of Granny and Jed Clampett . Plot centers on two chauffers who 've bet on which one of them can bed his employer ( both single or soon to be single ladies , quite sexy -- Bisset and Woronov ) first . If Manuel wins , his friend will pay off his debt to a violent asian street gang -- if he loses , he must play bottom man to his friend ! Lots of raunchy dialogue , fairly sick physical humour , etc . But a lot of the comedy is just beneath the surface . Bartel is memorable as a very sensual oder member of the family who ends up taking his sexy , teenaged niece on a year long `` missionary trip '' to Africa . Hilarious fun .
Ah , noir . My favourite genre . Otto Preminger 's follow-up to `` Laura '' is a film noir set in a postwar New York , where corruption and violence run rampant . It stars Dana Andrews as Sergeant Mark Dixon , a detective whose brutal tactics have landed him in hot water with his superiors . When he accidentally kills a murder suspect , Dixon tries to pin the blame on crime boss Tommy Scalese . Dixon is close to achieving his goal when he becomes involved with the dead man 's wife , the beautiful Morgan Taylor . Of course , in typical noir fashion , things quickly go down hill . While the film does nothing interesting camera or narrative wise , it does have a constant tone of dread and gloom . Like most great noirs , it is also wonderfully paced , sucking the viewer in right from the start . Still , like most of Preminger 's workmanlike films , it 's not something I 'd watch again . It lacks the verbal wit of Wilder , the visual flamboyance of Hitchcock or the spatial experimentation of Welles . Like Lang 's later work , `` Sidewalk '' feels very much a `` clone '' of what a noir should be , instead of something really artistically genuine . Thematically the film is nothing special . It 's about a cop who finds himself slowly becoming a criminal . In one scene Dixon explains that his father himself was a small time crook , the film flirting with the notion of predestination , but this one scene is as far as Otto goes , or dares to take his ideas . The camera work is likewise disappointing . There 's no intelligence in Otto 's camera . No effort is made to assign the camera to anything . It does n't play with space or architecture or empahsise the step-by-step police procedural . It 's just tripod set ups with the occasional dolly in and out . Meaningless , though most people do n't care about these things . There is , however , one good shot where our hero is trapped in a car full of gangsters ( noir cage ) which itself enters a vehicle-lift ( another cage ) and is taken up into the chief gangster 's lair . Like Lynch 's `` Blue Velvet '' , Otto retopologizes the film , constantly likens `` upstairs '' to hell . This works well , but the set design fails to reinforce it . 7/10 - Otto seems content to follow the Hawksian mould of what a noir is , rather than toy with the possibilities of where noir can go . Like `` Detour '' , `` Night in the City '' , `` Scarlet Street '' , `` In A Lonely Place '' , `` Act of Violence '' , `` Bomberang '' and `` Johnny Eager '' , `` Where the Sidewalk Ends '' is one of those well made second tier film noirs . It 's competent and engaging , but lacks that extra special magic .
Picture Bride has an excellent look into Hawaii 's past and the people who lived there in that time . The time , money earned and the hours that these people had put into their lives to survive and live , takes a whole new meaning to blood , sweat and tears . The concept of dating/matchmaking is something like what we do similar today via the net . Just that is more of snail mail . Very slow snail mail . The singing of the plantation 's songs from the workers reminds me of the southern plantation workers ' songs of their demise and future goals . The movie shows the hardship as well as soft romantic scenes that Hawaii can bring . Like the stillness of a storm coming and the sudden chaos of the rain and then the tranquility .
Short , but long enough , Cat Soup is a very wild trip to watch . One day , I was just searching though my On-demand list through the anime section and came across it , and decided to watch it . I spent the whole time basically sitting with my jaw agape . The whole time I was either vacant of thought , or had a fleeting one which screamed `` TURN IT OFF ! ! ! '' . But I did n't . And actually , I 'm glad I did . The animation is stunning . Very artistic , odd and dark . I personally loved it for the amazing animation , but the seemingly vacant story behind it is equally compelling for myself . A young boy -- well , cat -- goes in search of his sister 's soul . In the first part she 's lying sick in bed , and is soon paid by a visit from a sort of grim reaper . Her soul is split in half . One is regained by the cat boy while the other half is lost . Then the rest of the film is slightly lost to me , honestly . I expect they go back , and their world is ... perhaps slowly falling apart ? Maybe her absence of soul is the answer behind this , for the rest of the film contains various stages of which the world 's in . First there 's a giant flood , and next it dries up into a bleak desert , and then everything freezes ( thanks to either what is God or fate , as you will see ) . Then I believe they find the sister 's soul in the form of an orange flower . After that , the whole world disappears . Haha , totally did n't get that , but it sends shivers down my spine each time . Despite it 's seemingly random scenes , I 'm sure there 's a deeper message behind it if you watch it enough and do some research . Personally , I LOVE trippy stuff like this , and would love to spend time doing that just to understand it . But to some people it 's probably not their cup of tea . It comes off as highly disturbing , so if you like your straight forward anime , this is not a film for you . If you have an open mind however , I highly recommend this movie .
Beat a path to this important documentary that looks like an attractive feature . Forbidden Lie $ ( 2007 ) is simply a better ( cinematic ) version of Norma Khouri 's book Forbidden Love , and THAT was a best-seller . An onion-peeling of literary fraud and of a pretty woman , Lie $ is the very best in editorialised reality TV . Cleverly edited and colourful , Broinowski 's storytelling is chaptered by moving silhouettes of Norma Khouri meaningfully blowing smoke . I disagree ( with Variety ) that it 's overlong ; instead my one slight problem was with the episodic nature of its key players commenting on others ' just-recorded testimonials . On a single watching your sense of narrative becomes mired ... ..so I watched it twice . This Oscar-worthy effort is at once genuinely funny , upsetting , and totally engrossing as it documents one lie after another . The apparent con unfolded in the Australian State of Queensland via very personal swindles of Khouri 's friends and fans ( ! ) . Clearly these friends are now `` turned '' , the funniest on-camera line belonging to Khouri 's QLD neighbour Rachel Richardson who speaks her disillusionment in flat , no-nonsense colloquialisms : `` I think it 's a load of sh ! t . Personally '' . We need to learn from their experience , hence my belief in spoilers . Any perennial lie-spinner caught out in a lie will just say anything to buy time to tell another lie . There 's some breathtaking footage of Khouri cackling derisively at duping this very documentarian , who instead presses her ( con ) '' Artist '' repeatedly for corroboration . Since being busted by Sydney Morning Herald journalists Caroline Overington and David Knox a year after publication , Khouri has been on the run , but was tempted back to the director to supposedly clear her name . She absconded supposedly because a ) she 's either terrified of her sly , more-Italian-sounding-than-Greek husband , or b ) because she needed her passport/visas to clear her name . Unlikely . A more plausible reason was that the FBI regained her trail in Queensland before she again skipped overseas ( one guess : No , not Jordan ) . According to a closing card , Khouri is `` still under investigation by the FBI '' in 2007 . I guessed audiences might just give Khouri the benefit of the doubt once she invoked the need for utmost secrecy and subterfuge . Instead , the audiences I sat with slowly became just as disillusioned as the duped people on the screen . Once they caught on , there was plenty counter-derision and catcalls ; earlier , stressed sighs had emanated from audiencemembers who just did n't know how to take Khouri 's evolving contradictions . The filmmaker gets props for so beautifully spanning this convoluted tale from beginning to end , not leaving anything out -- not even her own self-sacrifice . Anna opens her film with a sympathetic book narration by Khouri herself . The putated reason for authoring it is retold very believably at first -- key to how a lifelong liar operates : in half-truths . Khouri is nevertheless a very pretty and smart 35yr-old with rather disarming charm , and surprisingly , worked-out biceps . Gradually we 're introduced to less-and-less-adulating Aussie journos , publishers and fans who at first bought the extent of Khouri 's honour-killing accusations hook , line and sinker . Later we see their more rueful reactions , quite self-controlled and matter-of-fact , if some perhaps a little bitter . It was Jordanian ( anti- ) honour-killing activists who took deepest umbrage at Khouri 's fallacies because its pot-stirring forced them to reduce the pace of change . Honour-killings do happen in Jordan ; it 's just their prevalence that 's at odds with Khouri 's book -- plus 72 other `` facts '' . In 2003 these activists faxed ( Australian ) Random House with 73 painstakingly-checked objections . The publishing houses across 4 continents who 'd jumped at the chance to publish first-time author Khouri never tried to check any facts . Leaving any corroborration to a disclaimer in their author contract , they too were fair game . So a massive hot-topic fraud was as easy to perpetrate upon the world as typing it up in Internet cafes . Later still we 're shocked to discover that the `` factual errors '' extend to Khouri 's bio as well . For one thing , she 's not only not a 35yr-old virgin ( her defence is that she merely did n't disabuse people of their assumptions ) , but she has a slickster husband and 2 teenagers ! Sometimes she 's just too fast-talking in her American accent . She also seems too-comfortable with cellphone technology and Western clothes . I realise observations like these might sound prejudicial to the very Jordanian women who do n't need any Western paternalism from me , but when even cultural cues do n't jibe in addition to Khouri 's `` facts '' , you 've got to start questioning your source . At some point the filmmaker came to the same conclusion . She makes an admirable effort to hold Khouri to account , in person , in Jordan . The last third is consumed with a fact-finding trip back to Amman , where one `` fact '' after another falls . Eventually Broinowski forces her ( con ) '' Artist '' to admit the decade-discrepancy in her story , and it 's after this that Khouri records her derisive secret confession into her own digital camera . Secret , because in it Khouri 's `` American security guard '' Jeremy is heard to have an Australian accent : he 's an actor ! ( We never find out how Anna uncovered it . ) So this becomes the filmmaker 's triumph , as she never flags in her tone or commitment . Her on-camera revelations lead her audience to learn from the mistakes of others given such a litany of reasonable doubt , FBI documents -- and Khouri 's most shocking initial crime . Anna Broinowski ( watch-list her now ) is even clever enough to use the one artistic device ( key players cross-commenting on footage ) to kill two birds -- making her audiences want to drink from the same well again . In fact , despite her deceptively demure approach , she made me re-confirm that Overington and Knox really DID win their 2004 Walkleys in Investigate Journalism for their `` Norma Khouri Investigation '' . Broinowski MADE ME LOOK . ( 10/10 )
Well , here 's another terrific example of awkward 70 's film-making ! The rudimentary premise of `` What 's the matter with Helen ? '' is quite shocking and disturbing , but it 's presented in such a stylish and sophisticated fashion ! In the hands of any other movie crew , this certainly would have become a nasty and gritty exploitation tale , but with director Curtis Harrington ( `` Whoever Slew Auntie Roo ? '' ) and scriptwriter Henry Farrell ( `` Hush Hush Sweet Charlotte '' ) in charge , it became a beautiful and almost enchanting mixture of themes and genres . The basic plot of the film is definitely horrific , but there 's a lot more to experience , like love stories , a swinging 1930 's atmosphere and a whole lot of singing and tap-dancing ! The setting is unquestionably what makes this movie so unique . We 're literally catapulted back to the 1930 's , with a sublime depiction of that era 's music , religion , theatrical business and wardrobes . Following the long and exhausting trial that sentenced their sons to life-imprisonment for murder , Adelle ( Debbie Reynolds ) and Helen ( Shelley Winters ) flee to California and attempt to start a new life running a dance school for young talented girls . Particularly Adelle adapts herself perfectly to the new environment , as she falls in love with a local millionaire , but poor old Helen continues to sink in a downwards spiral of insanity and paranoia . She only listens to the ramblings of a radio-evangelist , fears that she will be punished for the crimes her son committed and slowly develops violent tendencies . The script , although not entirely without flaws , is well written and the film is adequately paced . There 's never a dull moment in `` What 's the matter with Helen '' , although the singing , tap-dancing and tango sequences are quite extended and much unrelated to the actual plot . But the atmosphere is continuously ominous and the film definitely benefices from the terrific acting performance of Shelley Winters . She 's downright scary as the unpredictable and introvert lady who 's about to snap any second and , especially during the last ten minutes or so , she looks more petrifying than all the Freddy Kruegers , Jason Voorhees ' and Michael Myers ' combined ! There are several terrific supportive characters who are , sadly , a little underdeveloped and robbed from their potential , like Michéal MacLiammóir as the cocky elocution teacher , Agnes Moorehead as the creepy priestess and Timothy Carey as the obtrusive visitor to the ladies ' house . There are a couple of surprisingly gruesome scenes and moments of genuine shock to enjoy for the Grand Guignol fanatics among us , but particularly the set pieces and costume designs ( even nominated for an Oscar ! ) are breathtaking .
The Woman In Black is fantastic in all aspects . It 's scary , suspenseful and so realistic that you can actually see it happening in real life . I first saw this on the TV back in 1989 , and with all the lights off and the volume turned up , it was probably the most creepy experience of my entire life . I managed to get hold of a copy , and now , I make sure to bring it out every Halloween and show it too unsuspecting family members , who have no idea what they 're in for , and all I can do is laugh with glee . As for the film : It starts out with a young lawyer named Arthur Kipps , who is assigned by his firm to go to the market town of Crythin Gifford to settle the papers of a recently deceased client - Mrs. Alice Drablow . This film starts off as a reasonably solid and interesting ghost story . But then , Arthur attends the funeral , and from that scene on , we do not feel safe . We are constantly on edge and biting our nails , and that goes on for the next hour or so , until the final , thrilling finale . A warning to all new viewers though : do not watch this alone ...
This is a very real and funny movie about a Japanese man having a mid-life crisis . In Japan , ballroom dancing is not approved of . But when Shohei Sugiyama becomes obsessed with meeting the beautiful young girl he sees in the window of a dance studio , he suddenly finds himself enrolled in dance classes . No one is more surprised when he begins to like it than he . But he must keep his secret pleasure from his coworkers and family . When the truth comes out it is quite funny .
I had n't seen this film in probably 35 years , so when I recently noticed that it was going to be on television ( cable ) again for the first time in a very long time ( it is not available on video ) , I made sure I did n't miss it . And unlike so many other films that seem to lose their luster when finally viewed again , I found the visual images from the `` Pride of the Marines '' were as vivid and effective as I first remembered . What makes this movie so special , anyway ? Everything . Based on the true story of Al Schmid and his fellow Marine machine gun crew 's ordeal at the Battle of the Tenaru River on Guadalcanal in November , 1942 , the screenplay stays 95 % true to the book upon which it was based , `` Al Schmid , Marine '' by Roger Butterfield , varying only enough to meet the time constrains of a motion picture . This is not a typical `` war movie '' where the action is central , and indeed the war scene is a brief 10 minutes or so in the middle of the film . But it is a memorable 10 minutes , filmed in the lowest light possible to depict a night battle , and is devoid of the mock heroics or falseness that usually plagues the genre . In a way probably ahead of its time , the natural drama of what happened there was more than sufficient to convey to the audience the stark , ugly , brutal nature of battle , and probably shocked audiences when it was seen right after the war . This film is n't about `` glorifying '' war ; I ca n't imagine anyone seeing that battle scene and WANTING to enlist in the service . Not right away , anyway . What this film really concerns is the aftermath of battle , and how damaged men can learn to re-claim their lives . There 's an excellent hospital scene where a dozen men discuss this , and I feel that 's another reason why the film was so so well received -- it was exceptionally well-written . There 's a `` dream '' sequence done in inverse ( negative film ) that seems almost experimental , and the acting is strong , too , led by John Garfield . Garfield was perfect for the role because his natural temperament and Schmid 's were nearly the same , and Garfield met Schmid and even lived with him for a while to learn as much as he could about the man and his role . Actors do n't do that much anymore , but added to the equation , it 's just another reason why this movie succeeds in telling such a difficult , unattractive story .
After witnessing his wife ( Linda Hoffman ) engaging in sexual acts with the pool boy , the already somewhat unstable dentist Dr. Feinstone ( Corbin Bernsen ) completely snaps which means deep trouble for his patients . This delightful semi-original and entertaining horror flick from director Brian Yuzna was a welcome change of pace from the usual horror twaddle that was passed out in the late Nineties . Although The Dentist ' is intended to be a cheesy , fun little film , Yuzna ensures that the movie delivers the shocks and thrills that many more serious movies attempt to dispense . Despite suffering somewhat from the lack of background on the central characters , and thus allowing events that should have been built up to take place over a couple of days , the movie is intriguing , generally well scripted and well paced which allows the viewer to maintain interest , even during the more ludicrous of moments . The Dentist ' suffers , on occasion , from dragging but unlike the much inferior 1998 sequel , there are only sporadic uninteresting moments , and in general the movie follows itself nicely . Corbin Bernsen was very convincing in the role of the sadistic , deranged and perfectionist Dr. Alan Feinstone . The way Bernsen is able to credibly recite his lines , especially with regards to the foulness and immorality of sex ( particularly fellatio ) , is something short of marvellous . While many actors may have trouble portraying a cleanliness obsessed psycho without it coming off as too cheesy or ridiculous , Bernsen seems to truly fit the personality of the character he attempts to portray and thus makes the film all that more enjoyable . Had The Dentist ' not been intended to be a fun , almost comical , horror movie , Bernsen 's performance would probably have been much more powerful . Sadly , the rest of the cast ( including a pre-fame Mark Ruffalo ) failed to put in very good performances and although the movie was not really damaged by this , stronger performances could have added more credibility to the flick . The Dentist ' is not a horror film that is meant to be taken seriously but is certainly enjoyable , particularly ( I would presume ) for fans of cheesy horror . Those who became annoyed at the number of Scream ' ( 1996 ) clones from the late Nineties may very well find this a refreshing change , as I did . A seldom dull and generally well paced script as well as some proficient direction helps to make The Dentist ' one of the more pleasurable cheesy horrors from the 1990 's . On top of this we are presented with some particularly grizly and ( on the whole ) realistic scenes of dental torture , which should keep most gorehounds happy . Far from perfect but far from bad as well , The Dentist ' is a flick that is easily worth watching at least once . My rating for The Dentist '  6.5/10 .
This is a film which should be seen by anybody interested in , effected by , or suffering from an eating disorder . It is an amazingly accurate and sensitive portrayal of bulimia in a teenage girl , its causes and its symptoms . The girl is played by one of the most brilliant young actresses working in cinema today , Alison Lohman , who was later so spectacular in 'Where the Truth Lies ' . I would recommend that this film be shown in all schools , as you will never see a better on this subject . Alison Lohman is absolutely outstanding , and one marvels at her ability to convey the anguish of a girl suffering from this compulsive disorder . If barometers tell us the air pressure , Alison Lohman tells us the emotional pressure with the same degree of accuracy . Her emotional range is so precise , each scene could be measured microscopically for its gradations of trauma , on a scale of rising hysteria and desperation which reaches unbearable intensity . Mare Winningham is the perfect choice to play her mother , and does so with immense sympathy and a range of emotions just as finely tuned as Lohman 's . Together , they make a pair of sensitive emotional oscillators vibrating in resonance with one another . This film is really an astonishing achievement , and director Katt Shea should be proud of it . The only reason for not seeing it is if you are not interested in people . But even if you like nature films best , this is after all animal behaviour at the sharp edge . Bulimia is an extreme version of how a tormented soul can destroy her own body in a frenzy of despair . And if we do n't sympathise with people suffering from the depths of despair , then we are dead inside .
When I first heard about Moon Child , I thought it was a joke . After a few months , I figured I guess it 's for real . The few reviews I read that WERE N'T made by squealing fangirls were not very promising . When I was given the opportunity to watch it , I was fully prepared to groan , wince , and otherwise need to close my eyes to avoid the silliness . I was more than a little surprised , and in a good way . Yes , Moon Child has its moments of cheese , camp , and general dorkiness -- I think that 's kind of impossible to avoid when it involves Gackt Camui , a man not known for his sanity -- but all in all , it was wholly enjoyable . No , it is not a work of cinema genius but it is very , very heartfelt , amusing , with fun choreography , a touching score , and a fun cast . I know little of Japanese cinema so I ca n't really judge the acting but considering the fact that the cast was speaking a language or extreme dialect foreign to them at one time or another and that a couple of them have almost no acting experience , I was rather impressed . If you can enjoy a good action movie , a good drama , a good comedy , see this film . At least rent it since it 's coming to Region 1 . On a side note , there is zero homosexual/homoerotic content in this film . I did n't even see much of a subtext . Do n't let people that read too much into things ruin this for you .
The first `` side-story '' in the universal century Gundam universe presents a refreshing new look at the war between earth and the space colonies . The focus is no longer on a small group of individuals who would go on to play pivotal roles in the conflict , but on the everyday civilian population and how the war is seen through their eyes . The story does contain some Gundam staples , its premise being the attempts by a ZEON squad to capture an experimental Gundam , but it the execution of the plot that made this show so interesting to watch . This series focuses on the experiences of a young boy named Alfred and the relationship between his neighbor , Christina Mckenzie who is secretly a Federation pilot and a newbie Zeon pilot named Bernie Wiseman . Alfred develops a sort of `` brotherly love '' for Bernie while our young Zeon pilot also falls for Christina . `` War in the Pocket '' proves that you do not need a sweeping epic tale about special individuals to make for a good war story . There are no uber ace pilots or large scale fleet battles to be seen here . This short 6 episode OVA focuses a lot more on character emotional drama over other themes like politics or philosophy and i love how realistically portrayed the characters are . Alfred is your typical everyday kid who plays violent computer games and thinks the armed forces is cool . He is then given a crash course in the horrible realities of war . The unlikely friendship and bonding between Bernie and Christina , each not knowing the fact that they are soldiers on different sides of the war , is played very real without going overboard with the romance drama stuff . Same goes for the endearing relationship between Alfred and Bernie . That being said , i would not want to spoil much of the story here , but it makes it a whole lot more heart wrenching to watch the tragedies that unfold as the show moves along all the way to its emotionally devastating twist ending . Despite its lack of action , this show never falls into the category of `` boring '' . The characters are just that engaging enough to carry the whole show . Not to worry as there are a number of mobile suit action scenes scattered here and there . Each are beautifully animated on a level that surpasses that of an OVA and are sure to satisfy the craving for some `` mandatory '' mobile suit battles in a Gundam series . Normally watching anime in Japanese or English , i would leave up to personal preference . But in this case , i strongly recommend the English voice track over the Japanese one . Not only do the characters , whom all except Alfred are caucasian , sound more believable in English but the performances of the English voice cast are on par and even surpass the Japanese one , instilling each character with such realistic emotions and intonations that they sound just the acting in some live action TV dramas . In short , this show does not try to impress the audience . What it does is conveys numerous heartwarming themes that hit closest to home especially the death of innocence on the battlefield and the horrors of war through the eyes of a child . A truly moving little story that deserves more credit than it is being given .
This is the best and most original show seen in years . The more I watch it the more I fall in love with it . The cast is excellent , the writing is great . I personally like every character . However , there is a favorite character for everyone as there is a good mix of personalities and backgrounds just like in real life . I believe ABC has done a disservice to the writers , actors and to the potential audience of this show , to cancel so quickly and not advertise it enough nor give it a real chance to gain a following . There are so few shows I watch anymore as most TV is awful . This show in my opinion was right up there with my favorites Greys Anatomy and Brothers and Sisters . In fact I think the same audience for Brothers and Sisters would love this show if they even knew about it . Why is it always the loser shows that get so much extra time and the winning shows with great potential always get dumped right away . I am so sick of reality shows I do not watch any of them . It was so refreshing to have a new idea for a show and then to hire excellent actors , this show had so much promise . The recent episode was the best one yet as everyone has started to really get into their parts and make the show so real . Please watch this show on ABC 's video and let ABC know you wish to have this show back . PLEASE SIGN THE ONLINE PETITION TO ABC : http : //www.PetitionOnline.com/gh1215/petition.html
This is one of the more adorable episodes of the Twilight Zone , with some fun dialog and amusing characters to break the tension of some creepy moments . There 's the usual blond vamp `` dancer '' ( what is up with Serling 's fondness for that kind of character , such that she keeps showing up in various episodes ? ) and other assorted characters , but it 's Jack Elam 's `` old man '' who totally steals the show . I consider this the funny , light-hearted version of `` The Monsters Are Due on Maple Street '' -- or , perhaps , a 20-minute Twilight Zone parody of `` The Thing . '' On another note : I thought the young lover of the episode might be someone who eventually went on to other things -- he looked familiar -- but it seems that `` Ron Kipling '' disappeared after just two TV credits to his name .
I 'd have given this film a few stars , simply because it was a `` Lifetime '' presentation actually filmed in the location represented in the story - here , New York City . Most on this channel , whether `` set '' there , in rural Iowa , Oregon , Virginia , L.A . etc. , are filmed in Vancouver , Ottawa , Toronto or some other Canadian locale . But if there ever were one deserving the top rating - 10* on this site , it 's this movie . Certainly not for originality , for this story has been done many times , in many variations , with several very similar to this specific one . It 's also been done pretty often on the big screen , with mega-stars , past and present , from Cary Grant , James Garner , Harrison Ford , Tom Hanks , et al - and Deborah Kerr , Doris Day , Meg Ryan , and many more . I can think of at least 10-12 more , just as prominent , past to present , off the top of my head , who could be added now , and there are probably many others which could be brought to mind . Not to drone on , but my point is that , in my opinion , this is by far one of the best of this genre I 've seen . I caught it by chance on a mid-day Friday , at a time when I had the TV on only because I was taking a couple of hours following a particularly hectic week . I 'd never run across this flick in the 8 years since it was made . And , while the two leads have done enough to be known to most , they were completely unknown to me . The only two actors I knew were Phyllis Newman ( Anna 's mother ) whom I 'd seen in some things from her younger days , and Michael Rispoli ( Henry , Charlie 's best friend ) who was outstanding as `` Gramma , '' the menacing juice loan , tough , street guy from `` Rounders . '' The chance meeting and coupling between both leads ' best friends , as a sub-story romance , with the correlation of their being such to Anna and Charlie being only revealed to all later , is an oft-done plot contrivance within the genre , but makes no difference to the enjoyment here ( in fact , it enhances it ) . Checking some other comments , I agree completely with those which are the most positive . The primary word describing this film is ENGAGING , in caps . This adjective describes the performers ; the characters ; the chemistry between and among all of the characters , in whatever combination presented , and all of the supporting and even minor roles . I love films with a `` harder edge : '' `` Rounders ; '' the escapist Schwarzenegger/Stallone fare ; `` Goodfellows ; '' even the classics like `` Casablanca , '' `` Gone With the Wind , '' `` Citizen Kane . '' But for pure , uncomplicated enjoyment , this one was outstanding . With a bare fraction of their budgets , it was equal to the results achieved by `` You 've Got Mail '' and `` Sleepless in Seattle . '' And Tom Hanks and Meg Ryan could n't have done better than Natasha Henstridge and Michael Vartan here ; the co-stars and support personnel here were equivalent to those in these mega-films , as well .
Being that I am a true product of the hip-hop and electronic dance music generation , this is without a doubt one of my favorite movies of all time . Beat Street , although not as `` authentic '' in some respects as Wild Style , is a film that is guaranteed to tug the heart strings of anyone who takes pride in the culture of urban sample/DJ-based music and electro-club culture . Although I will admit that at times the dialogue is somewhat cheesy , you ca n't help but feel for the characters , and ultimately `` wish you were there '' for the beginnings of hip-hop culture in New York City in the early eighties . The b-boy battle scene at the Roxy nightclub ( a real-life , real-time competition between the legendary Rock Steady Crew and the NYC Breakers ) is just as essential to a hip-hop fan 's archives as any classic album . Watch some of the breakers ' moves in slow-motion if possible to truly appreciate the athletic and stylistic expertise of a seasoned B-boy/B-girl . All praises due to the Zulu Nation ! ! !
My introduction into Yoji Yamada 's cinematic world is through his famed and recent Samurai Trilogy with The Twilight Samurai , The Hidden Blade and Love and Honor . I had enjoyed all three films , and looking at the prolific , veteran director 's filmography , I think it 'll take me a very long while to watch all his films , especially the Tora-san series . Needless to say when Kabei Our Mother has finally reached our shores , I jumped at the chance to watch what would be an ode to Mothers everywhere , celebrating their innate love for their children . Based on the autobiography of Teruyo Nogami , Kabei - Our Mother tells of a close knit family of four  Mother Kayo `` Kabei '' ( Sayuri Yoshinaga ) , Father Shigeru `` Tobei '' ( Mitsugoro Bando ) , eldest daughter Hatsu ( Mirai Shida ) and youngest child Teru ( Miku Sato ) . From the get go their lives would be changed forever , when Shigeru gets arrested under the Peace Preservation Law for his morally controversial writings against the nation , set in the late 30s where Japan had begun their `` crusade '' in China , and thereafter their participation in WWII . So begins Kabei 's struggle to hold down jobs to feed her family , and the frequent , difficult meetings with her husband behind bars . Help comes from relatives , especially on Shigeru 's side , since Kabei 's own dad had adopted an `` I told you so '' attitude with her choice of spouse . Shigeru 's one time student Yama ( arthouse buffs should recognize Tadanobu Asano here ) provides laughter as a bumbling man who slowly becomes confidante and surrogate guardian to the children , and Kabei 's sister in law Hisako ( Rei Dan ) from Hiroshima , which I believe would have sounded some hindsight alarm bells as to her unfortunate fate as the film progresses through its timeline . While the film centers primarily on how the kids are growing up under the presence of their mom , and in a distant relationship with their dad , what I enjoyed is how the microscopic family events unfold under the macroscopic worldwide events that have impacted on the common folk in Japan . It 's against the historical backdrop of Japan 's push to regional dominance , and there are characters here that do n't mask those ambitions , even discussing what the country would eventually do should it be successful in holding onto conquered lands . This is something I rarely see in Japanese films , being that frank in their discussion of that era , and also to get a glimpse of how the common man have to struggle against domestic issues made all the more difficult with resources channeled toward the war effort . The actresses casted here are pitch perfect in their delivery and roles , be they the veterans or the child actors . Actress Sayuri Yoshinaga deserves special mention for her role as the motherly figure who has to dig deep and find that inner strength to carry the household through under trying circumstances , while Mirai Shida and Miku Sato are lovable as the understanding children who have to learn to make do and compromise . Each scene with the three of them together just makes it heart wrenching when the going gets tough , or fill your heart with Joy should they be celebrating . Before long you 'll soon find yourself being attracted to want to be part of this family , thanks to the primary cast 's powerful performances , with Yoji Yamada coaxing some really natural performances from the kids . Kabei - Our Mother boasts some stunningly beautiful art direction , and is classy in its delivery of both happy and sad moments without going over the top , or relying on cheap melodrama to cheapen the emotions it seeks from the audience . There are plenty of little things here done right which makes it pitch perfect , with every scene not being wasted , and with every nuance very meaningful in conveying its message across , be it compassion or love . Aside from the very abrupt ending ( I had hoped that it could have continued for a lot more , despite its more than 2 hours runtime ) , Kabei Our Mother comes highly recommended , and you 'll find it difficult to be holding back either your tears , or that thought about your own mom and her sacrifices she makes for you on an everyday basis . Just what those sacrifices are should you need another reminder , then the scene during the end credits roll will remind you of the stuff that you 'd probably have taken for granted .
Is this the future that awaits us ? An overpopulated , unforgiving wasteland with a hellish , unwanted existence ? This film brings to mind a problem that still plagues us , doubly so since the film was released in back in 1973 . Let 's hope that the world is n't going to end up like this ... Soylent Green is a wild movie that I enjoyed very much . It had likable characters , a semi-apocalyptic setting , a compelling and thought-provoking storyline , and the macho-est macho man out there : Charleton Heston . Richard Fleischer gave the movie a very unpleasant , dirty feel . You 're almost choked by the stench from the city and its filthy inhabitants . The characters are wonderful . Charleton Heston , who has become one of my favorite actors , IS Thorn . The man created this role of badass , yet likable tough-guy . I could definitely put myself in Thorn 's shoes . He sees that something is n't right , but everyone around him either does n't listen ( more like paid not to listen ) or wants him dead . Edward G. Robinson ( in his last film , R.I.P . ) plays the lovable old Sol , who has had enough of this nasty place . Everyone else is great , especially Leigh Taylor-Young as Shirl , a piece of `` furniture '' that comes with the apartment in which she resides . The special effects are fantastic , even for 1973 . The Soylent Green factory , the futuristic apartments , and especially the `` scoops '' ( bulldozers that get rid of people ) were excellent . The polluted air outside looks disgusting and very nasty . The empty city streets filled with the vile and putrid people are very unsettling . One final note is the ending , which even now still shocked me . It is gruesome , but if you think about it , it 's a pretty good idea . The Bottom Line : An excellent 70 's Science Fiction flick that makes you think and leaves you feeling very uneasy .
Marlon Brando and Frank Sinatra HATED each other while doing this film and in the years following it.Brando asked Sinatra for some singing lessons , but Sinatra ( who was already upset over the fact that he was cast as Nathan Detroit , when he wanted the part of Skye Masterson ) wanted to be the star singer in the production and did n't want any one to be better than he was.He told Brando to get lost , so to get back at him Marlon kept screwing up the scene in the diner where Sinatra was eating cheesecake so that he would have to keep eating , eating and eating.In the later years , Sinatra gave Brando the nickname `` Mumbles '' or `` Mr.Mumbles '' because of the way he talks .
I 'm amazed we see even one nay-sayer criticizing this old film . We do n't ordinarily get good opera films , and here is a true grand opera rendition . Understandably , the visuals are not great . It 's dated . But as opera it ca n't be faulted ; and I 'm an opera buff . I ca n't even detect one lip-sync ; if we did n't know that was Tebaldi in the audio nothing would convince me it is n't Sophia Loren . She does EVERYTHING with flair ! Her dark makeup is fine ; and she brought the role to gorgeous life ! The rest of the cast is wonderful , as is that stunning ballet troupe . Most of the actors are excellent ; Loren truly marvelous . Her rival Amneris is also terrific . Whoever did n't care for this 1953 job is shamefully remiss . Verdi would have enjoyed it ! Naturally , Renata Tebaldi as Aida is the engine behind the scenes . I love this old movie !
The synopsis for this movie does a great job at explaining what to expect . It 's a very good thriller . Well shot . Tough to believe it was Bill Paxton 's directorial debut , though some shots do look EXACTLY like a storyboard version . Still , there are a few shots that really look good and show some real imagination on the part of Paxton . It 's a solid story with some great twists at the end , several of them , all believable , all fun , and best of all , obscured well enough to make them true twists . The child actors in the movie do a great , too . I 'm usually wary of movies with kids in starring roles because all too often they come off as Nickelodeon rejects , but both these kids do a good job . This movie is not gory . It 's not very scary . But it IS very , very creepy .
The first of two Jim Thompson adaptations released in 1990 ( the other being the more well-known GRIFTERS ) , AFTER DARK has all of Thompson 's hallmarks : dangerous women , the confidence game , and characters that are either not as dim as others suspect them of being , or not as harmless . Jason Patric is superb as a former boxer disqualified from the sport for life due to an incident in the ring ( director James Foley uses RAGING BULL-esquire sequences to flesh out the back story ) and the too-little-seen Rachel Ward also delivers a great performance . But Bruce Dern is the film 's secret weapon : his sweet-talking grifter Uncle Bud subtly commands each of his scenes . there 's almost no comic relief in this film , so watch it prepared to be sucked into the void .
What a real treat and quite unexpected . This is what a real thriller movie is all about . I rushed into the video shop , grabbed a movie without reading the entire blurb on the back and hoped for the best . I was totally surprised and delighted . I really enjoyed the actors and their characters . I thought they all gave a great performance and made their characters realistic . The plot was well thought out , well written and directed . It kept you interested from start to finish and never got boring for a single minute . I highly recommend this movie for those that like thrillers , especially thrillers that are well paced and ones that keep your attention . Definitely a 10 out of 10 from me .
Will and Ted 's Bodacious journey is an existential trip through themes of mortality , religion , time , Heaven and Hell , man 's quest for fame and his fears of the body being overcome by a soulless machine . It is the most intelligent work of fiction since Paradise Lost and references many great past works of art- Dante , Iron Maiden , Virgil , Shakespeare . This time the dudes are a famous rock band having travelled through time collecting icons from the past- Napolean , Joan Of Ark ( Noah 's wife ) , Oscar Wilde , and Charles Darwin . They took the skills they learned from each of these people , abducted a couple of Princesses , and finally learned to play their guitars and write hit songs . These songs teach the world to love again and war , hunger , evil are vanquished for eternity . We fast forward into the distant future where an evil dictator who despises good music called Simon Cow-Al wants to rule the world . He eats Rooshus ( the cool guy from the first film who helps Bill Playboy Esquire and Ted Theodore Alvin ) and gains the power to send two cyborgs back in time . The cyborgs are living tissue over metal exoskeleton and coated in mimetic poly alloy allowing them the survive the turmoil of time travel , and they can imitate anything they sample by physical contact . It is their job to Kill the good Biff and Fred and take over their lives by making terrible music that no-one could like . By doing this they will change the world forever- Gryll and Jed 's music will never be made leaving a world of war , famine , and hatred , and more annoyingly , bland boy/girl group pop music . There is a startling twist as the good guys actually are killed and they have to work out a way to save the world , themselves , and their wives from the evil Dopplebangers inhabiting their bodies . Penelope Spheerhead shows her knowledge of both youth culture and real culture by mixing modern day music and phrases with post modern sets and artistic references , and seeks to teach us all something by delving into our very psyche to show us ourselves . She presents the nightmares which faced the late 80s teen in a society which had abandoned them and beckons us to dissect the post structuralist jingoism , self love , and malaise of the time . Charging us with a belief that we can indeed change the world it is an inspiring message , but in order to achieve such dreams we must traverse and indeed face our nightmares . To overcome is to succeed , to defeat Death is the first step in truly living and not merely surviving . In the words of Kenneth Reeves- 'Wow ! ' Best Scene : For a fun game- see how many songs , bands , and albums cover references you can spot throughout the film . There are at least 6 .
Red Rock West is a perfect example of how good a film can be with practically no budget . All you need is a smart script , good actors and loads of atmosphere . RRW delivers all these and more . Nic Cage plays an ex-marine , injured in Lebanon , who is down to his last 5 dollars after being refused a job on an oilfield because of his bad knee . He roles into Red Rock and is mistaken by bartender Wayne ( JT Walsh , not quite as his most menacing-but still evil ) for a hit-man from Texas . He pays him to kill his wife and make it look like burglary . Only when he gets there , just to check her out . She offers him double to kill Wayne . Cage just wants to get the hell out of town with his free money and leave the sparring lovers be . But a series of mishaps and setbacks results in him yo-yoing in and out of Red Rock , back and forth . Eventually this leads to a run-in with Lyle from Dallas ( a cheeky and somehow sympathetic Dennis Hopper ) , the REAL hit-man from Texas who offers to help without knowing he 's making the plot more complicated . RRW never had a big release , thus most of it 's audience discovered it on video or on cable TV showings . Viewing it in such a way might make it seem like a TV movie but it 's bigger than that . The slick , slowly-timed direction , moody score and howling desert wind would have all made for a great movie in theatres but the best you can do these days is watch the DVD on a big HDTV . The only weak point of the movie I can think of is Lara Flynn Boyle 's boring femme fatale with the nasty dyke-ish hairdo . I certainly would n't fall for her but if you assume that Nic Cage 's character is in to militant lesbians then you 'll accept it nonetheless .
I remember seeing this on TV in the late 70s - and it stayed with me ! It 's charming , loud , colourful - a great kids film . I put it on for some friends at a party recently - and naturally they thought I was mad and expected something sick to happen to the puppets a la `` Meet the feebles '' But no - its wholesome clean fun . jack wild is in fine form , as is mama cass , and the somehow attractive witchy poo . If you like the banana splits and you are in your 30 's this will re-create that surreal childhood Saturday morning vibe ! Even if I 've realised now that Puf himself is a bit crap - as all he does is get captured and run away ! Quality TV movie - if , like me , you are into death metal - you 'll love it !
~~I was able to see this movie yesterday morning on a early viewing pass~~ I am a mom of 2 children , who range from 11 down to 6 . So I 'm sure plenty of parents can relate to having to see many many `` kids '' movies . This was refreshing for me . I have n't read this particular book , so I do n't know if it stayed true to the book or not . But it sure took the grossness factor to a high level . This is the story of the `` new '' kid in town and it just so happens that there are a group of boys who have formed a club of sorts and love to pick on kids ... .sound familiar ? Have n't we all suffered this one time or another . He has the little brother who he cant stand and parents that he is embarrassed about . What I enjoyed most of all was seeing how each character was totally different from another they all stood out . The bully ( why do they always make the bully a red head ? My daughter has red hair ! and she is no bully ! ..lol ) is well a great bully , who finds himself being yelled at by his own big brother . It took twists and turns and well you fall in love with all of them and really find yourself routing for all the characters ! Even the parents , great connection between father and son . All around enjoyable , sweet , funny , gross etc ... ... Take your kids ! ! ! You will enjoy it as much as they do !
A somewhat fictionalized biographical portrait of Abraham Lincoln 's early years from Director John Ford , concentrating primarily on a trial in which the young lawyer defends two brothers accused of murder . The film offers an interesting portrayal of this important American figure and the film is well made , but seems somewhat incomplete without any of the great moments from his presidency or even his debates with Stephen Douglas . The obvious intent was to portray Lincoln as young man developing the attributes that would make him the great man he would become . But the result for me was that while I admired the portrayal it just was n't as satisfying as I think it could have been with a greater scope . In the role of Abraham Lincoln we have Henry Fonda who effectively displays a quiet strength . Fonda 's performance includes some gangly mannerisms ' and other affectations which are fairly effective in presenting a portrayal of Lincoln , particularly when combined with some effective makeup and the costuming which occasionally is a bit to overt . The supporting cast is solid and surprisingly does not include that many of Ford 's regular supporting cast ( sometimes referred to as his stock company ) but we do have Ward Bond one of the most prolific character actors in Hollywood . Bond has appeared in more of the AFI Top 100 Films than any other actor , both the original and revised list . He has also appeared in 11 Best Picture Nominees . The film features one scene that would seem to have inspired a quite similar scene in `` To Kill a Mockingbird '' , where it would be done even better than it is here , even though that scene is one of the most effective in this film .
I would highly recommend this movie ! And I certainly shall be personally recommending it to my friends and family here and abroad ! It was with excited anticipation , that I have just pre-ordered it online , I enjoyed it so much ! It is not out until February/March 2008 , but it will be well worth the wait ! But first go and see it in the cinema if you can . There is nothing quite like the Cinema-Experience of a cinema-made movie ! Insist that your local cinema puts it on ! I went to see 'Seachd , the Inaccessible Pinacle ' tonight , down here in London , and was really impressed . It is a marvel : a truly beautiful film set in the Scottish Highlands : you will laugh , you will cry , you will be moved in may different ways , you will be intrigued , and as the story within the stories is revealed , you will be amazed at that revelation . This movie is in Scottish Gaelic with English Subtitles , but do not let that detract you if you are not a speaker of the Gaelic : I am just starting , and my son does not , nor did many people there tonight , and it did not spoil it for us by any manner of means ! Superlatives do not suffice ! The photography is superb - there is no CGI here , and the movie is all the better for that- here you have true photography ! The script is so skilfully and subtly written . The many-layered plot weaves the magic art of the ancient storytellers . The music is at times rousing , at times haunting , but always adding to the atmospheric ambiance . And the acting ? ... it is to behold ... and the actors ? ... they the true weavers of this delightful yet profound film , particularly the two main actors , 'Padruig-the-young ' and 'Padruig-the-elder ' ( A true bard , if ever there was ! ) , who both carried a very heavy load ! And the Direction ? Well watch out Richard ! And the Producer , responsible for raising funding , hiring key personnel , and arranging for distributors ? A task well done ! I hope that you will make sure that distribution goes out to our communities abroad ! And the Gaelic community ? Uill , without you it could not have happened ! We were told that this movie was made on a low budget , but you would not know it , and I think it might well be because , for what they might have lacked in money , they more than made up for with the richness of the heart , and the warmth and co-operation of the local Scottish Gaelic community . A heartfelt thanks to all concerned in the making , and the sponsoring , of 'Seachd ' - Mòran taing ! ( Many thanks ! ) From the Gaels to the World ! From the World to the Gaels !
Touching ; Well directed autobiography of a talented young director/producer . A love story with Rabin 's assassination in the background . Worth seeing !
I love buying those cheap , lousy DVD 's from Alpha Video . One day , I happened to buy this one . It 's the perfect silly science fiction film of the 50 's , all sexed up . Replete with unscientific EVERYTHING , scantily clad girls and plenty of melodrama , it 's an enjoyable film , to those who appreciate this kind of stuff . And if you can 'suspend your disbelief ' enough , you can actually get creeped out -- not just by the psychotic head or by the beating of the thing in the closet , but toward the end , with the character of 'the perfect body ' . It 's so . . . . what 's another word for mindf***ing ?
My what a director 's intuition can bring on material that needs just the right nudge in the right directions . Young Mr. Lincoln is filled up with some 'old-fashioned ' values , which in retrospect , despite its two-dimensional portrayal , is at least more respectably done than one might see in the pap in current cinema . What makes it work so extremely well as it does , in all its simplicity and grandeur , is that its a truly great courtroom drama in the guise of a history lesson . We all know of Abraham Lincoln as the 16th president that did the emancipation and after the Civil war got assassinated . But as the lawyer in his earlier years he was charismatic , funny in the most unexpected places , and a true gentleman . He 's not some superhero that can do no wrong ( which was Fonda 's only apprehension to the part before signing on ) , but a figure with possible flaws that are surpassed by his innate goodness and clear sight of right and wrong . It 's suffice to say that John Ford is exceptional as a storyteller almost without trying . Actually , it 's a lie , he does try , but he makes it sort of effortless in the studio system ; he worked in an independent manner while also pleasing simultaneously Zanuck , so he was pretty much left alone to his own succinct practices in `` editing in camera '' , and not moving it around so as to not waver far off from the story . It 's this strength of conventional wisdom that somehow works hand in hand with the material , as a kind of companion piece to the full-blooded Americana in 1939 as seen in Mr. Smith Goes to Washington ( only here it 's the law and not politics ) . Fonda is terrific in the lead- his first with Ford- and never lets us loose sight of Lincoln past the make-up and extra boost in the shoes . Fonda 's own personality , in a sense , as it would in Grapes of Wrath and My Darling Clementine , comes out in the character of Lincoln . However unlikely it might be , there 's no one else from this period that could have played him then : he 's mature and wise , but has the gumption to prove himself in this case of a convoluted he-saw-that-but-did-she murder case . Only in little bits and pieces , like that final shot which superimposes Lincoln walking down the road with his monument , and a couple of small instances during that big parade scene early on , seem pretty dated . As far as the goals set out with Young Mr. Lincoln , there were all met by Ford and his crew and cast ; it 's not as hokey as one might think going in , and it 's got a strong balance of humor and genuine pathos .
After you see Vertigo , then watch Bell , Book and Candle , made within months of each other . My second favorite Kim Novak film , with Picnic , coming in as third . All three performances are great , Vertigo , being the best , of all . They came to my nowhere Kansas Prairie town , near by , at Salina , Kansas in the 50s , to film , Picnic . Bell , Book and Candle 's musical score , I believe is one of Alex North 's . Perfect for this bit of comedy . After Vertigo , Stewart and Novak , did this comedy , how amusing to note the dramatic contrast . Worth your time , if you like Kim Novak . The Greta Garbo of my youth .
One of the joys of picking up the recent Bela Lugosi collection is getting to see delightful movies like The Invisible Ray . Boris Karloff and Bela Lugosi team up in a movie that delves into meteorites and radiation and while the science is all perfectly absurd ( especially the camera technique Karloff , as Janos Rukh , uses to determine the site of a certain meteorite ) and downright laughable , I did n't care in the lease because the movie is thoroughly enjoyable . The effects are done well for the time , the acting is great , and the finish is particularly strong . It reminds me of the pulp sci-fi comics and novels of the 1940s and '50s , complete with ray guns and ridiculous science . You must watch this movie !
I would like to comment on the movie April Love . It 's one of my all time favorites because my father , Nelson Malone plays the horse trainer . I remember distinctly when Hollywood came to Lexington , KY , where we were living at the time to make April Love . My Dad had been in numerous plays and was a talented man . I talked him into going to try out for one of the bit parts offered , and lo and behold he came home w/the script . How exciting is that ! Also , a number of my classmates were in the crowd scenes -- especially the ones shown at the amusement park . It 's very nostalgic every April when I see the movie being shown once again , and the song April Love by Pat Boone is still played on the radio . Timeless and reminiscent of a time long gone when you see the movies they make today w/all the sex , foul language and violence . It would be refreshing to see more movies like April Love come back into focus ...
This game is the bomb and this is the 007 game of the year and should be on greatest hits . When I got Agent Under Fire , I thought that was a good game but then Nightfire came around and that was better , but now there is a new type of James Bond game . This time it a 3rd person shooter and there is more than 12 missions , the graphics of the game are out of this house . It even has all of the great actors and actresses in this game like Pierce Bronsan as once again James Bond , William Dafoe as the villain Nikolai Diavolo , and Judi Dench as M ( forgive me all if I spell it wrong ) . This game would be own as the greatest James Bond game around . I give this a 10/10
This is a film about deep and unspoken human relationships . Eventually they do become spoken , but is there a chance to change anything about the situation . Originally made in Shanghai 1948 and quite free of propaganda the film introduces us to the Dai Family . There is still some weight about the history that surrounds the family . History usually has weight in Chinese literature and serious film . A young married couple - Liyan , an invalid , and his wife Yuwen live in a once great family compound that is partially ruined . A bright contrast is Liyan 's young sister who can not really remember the past of the family but accepts everything in quite a natural way . Her spirit is as bright as the other two are reserved . Into this apparently stable world comes an unexpected visitor ... I ended up feeling quite sad - but definitely a superior film .
Otto Preminger 's noir classic works almost as a flip-side of LAURA ... while that film was glitzy and features the high fa-luting Clifton Webb , this film is a whole lot seamier . Dana Andrews is a less than good cop who accidentally kills a man only to have it potentially pinned on the father of the girl he loves . Preminger keeps things moving at a brisk clip so that lapses in logic are easily overlooked . Andrews is quite fine ( a lot less wooden than he 's been in the past ) and the stunningly beautiful Gene Tierney is stunningly beautiful ! Creepy Craig Stevens plays the unlucky victim . WHERE THE SIDEWALK ENDS is a must see and a terrific companion-piece to Preminger 's equally lurid WHIRLPOOL ( also starring Tierney ) .
This is a rip-roaring British comedy movie and one that i could watch over and over again without growing tired . Peter Ustinov has never performed in a bad role and this is no exception , particularly with his dry wit but very clever master plan . Karl Malden has always been an admirer of mine since he starred in 'Streets of San Francisco ' . I believe that Maggie Smith is the real star of this film though , appearing to be so inept at everything she tries to do but in truth is so switched on , particularly at the end when she informs everyone that she has invested so much money that she has discovered whilst laundering his clothes . One thing does concern me though , could someone please tell me why i can not purchase this on either DVD or VHS format in the UK , could someone please assist ?
As of this writing John Carpenter 's 'Halloween ' is nearing it 's 30th anniversary . It has since spawned 7 sequels , a remake , a whole mess of imitations and every year around Halloween when they do those 'Top 10 Scariest Movies ' lists it 's always on there . That 's quite amazing for a film that was made on a budget of around $ 300,000 and featured a then almost completely unknown cast of up and coming young talent . I could go on and on , but the big question here is : How does the film hold up today ? And all I can say to that is , fantastically ! Pros : A simple , but spooky opening credits sequence that really sets the mood . An unforgettable and goosebump-inducing score by director/co-writer John Carpenter and Alan Howarth . Great cinematography . Stellar direction by Carpenter who keeps the suspense high , gets some great shots , and is careful not to show too much of his villain . Good performances from the then mostly unknown cast . A good sense of humor . Michael Myers is one scary , evil guy . A lot of eerie moments that 'll stay with you . The pace is slow , but steady and never drags . Unlike most other slasher films , this one is more about suspense and terror than blood and a big body count . Cons : Probably not nearly as scary now as it was then . Many of the goofs really stand out . Final thoughts : I want to start out this section by saying this is not my favorite film in the series . I know that 's not a popular opinion , but it 's really how I feel . Despite that it truly is an important film that keeps reaching new generations of film buffs . And just because it 's been remade for a new generation does n't mean it 'll be forgotten . No way , no how . My rating : 5/5
There is a certain genius behind this movie . I was laughing throughout . The scene in the phone sex office , discussing how love heals the doppelganger was a nice attempt at this genius/humor . Execution is poor , but you can see the writer 's message and they do have some talent . The doppelganger split at the end was like ... `` ok , was n't quite expecting that but let 's see what the movie has to say '' . Certainly ridiculous , but a sweet idea and actually very coherent to the story in a strange way . Is the point of a movie to be logical or is it to be entertaining or communicate on an emotional level ? i 'm easily bored by many movies , but this one kept my interest throughout . I think the story may have some auto-biographical roots , but that 's just a guess . Horribly bad , but good . I 'm looking for other movies this person may have done ( with more experience ) .
As an anti-football person , I ( on the surface ) grudgingly took my younger brother to see this film , although secretly I hoped it might be East is East II . The trailers looked fun so I thought I 'd give it a go . It took about ten minutes but after that I was glued to the screen , and that was n't anything to do with the neck cramp caused by sitting too near the front due to a packed auditorium . The acting was fresh and vibrant , the characters engaging , and the jokes genuinely funny . The entire auditorium was laughing out loud every minute or so . Football fan or no football fan , sport became irrelevant to the main principles of love , friendship , family , independence and rivalry . Add a dash of Sikh culture and you have the formula for the best British comedy I 've seen in a long time , dare I say it ... . better than East is East . This film trots along nicely at a lovely pace , never dwelling on anything longer than necessary nor leaving anything unfinished , keeping the viewer entertained and mentally engaged . Though not a characteristically twisting-and-turning film , there are some pleasant surprises on the way and things do n't always happen as you would expect . Saying that , there were elements of predictability but these were exploited satirically more than used as script-fillers . I suppose depending on your particular penchant for happy-endings you could be either delighted/let down by the ending . Personally , if there was any other outcome I would have written a strongly worded letter to the script writers . As for the actors , I would have to say that Juliet Stevenson ( Paula ) put in the finest performance . I never knew that people like that existed but she her realism with sometimes bizarre concepts has convinced me that they possibly do ! Prize for the most unconvincing ( of the main characters ) goes , unfortunately , to Kiera Knightley ( Jules ) , but do n't get me wrong , even she offered a great performance , it 's just that someone has to be last of the best and sorry Kiera , this time you 're it . Tip : Do n't leave before the credits . Once the lights came back up I realised to my horror that perhaps I should n't have watched this film after all . My beloved but forgotten Ice Junkie had melted into a sugary blue juice . Oh , what am I saying , it was absolutely brill and I ca n't recommend it enough . I will definitely buy it when it comes out and add it to my collection of 3 videos . I 'm a student . I only splash out if it 's really worth it .
For the viewer who comes upon it long after its making , `` Winchester '73 '' has something in common with `` Casablanca . '' While you watch it , you get this feeling that you 're looking at a string of clichés encountered so often in the genre ; then you realise that the clichés became clichés only after being copied from this particular film , and that they were so widely copied because this film was so great . In other words , it 's a seminal work . `` Winchester '73 '' is a joy to watch . The broad lines of the plot are somewhat predictable , but mostly because you 've seen them copied so many times in later movies , and nevertheless it still contains a number of twists which surprise you . The dialogue , the pacing and Mann 's direction are excellent . Stewart shines in particular , and if you 're a fan this is a `` must-see , '' but he is not alone in delivering a good performance . Remarkably , many of the most thoughtful and/or witty lines go to minor characters . Because this makes these characters ( much ) more than cardboard cutouts , it lent additional realism to the film . This is a remarkably underrated film , and well worth keeping an eye out for . The DVD also contains an interview with Stewart which provides some background on the film .
I agree with the other comments . I saw this movie years ago . Christopher Plummer is hilarious as a dandy . The ribaldry is unsurpassed . If this comes out on video , I will definitely buy it .
A realistic depiction of young love for the college set but also appealing to an older viewer like me . It has ups and downs and twists and turns and made me shed a tear or two . We rarely see movies with black urban characters that could appeal to older , non black audiences and show a more real life depiction of young black adults . This movie takes place on a college campus and town where two people meet and fall in love . In the background are various friends acquaintances and situations that impact them for better or worse . Typical plot some may say , but this really was unexpected . I found myself rooting for the survival of the couple 's relationship , seeing my own past in their story . Moments of deep thought and revelation came pouring out of the actors performances . It 's a bright film that I would endorse for those young at heart and in love or have ever been in love . Great movie . I 'll be looking for a copy to add to my movie collection .
When a movie shocks you with it 's disturbing , brooding atmosphere , and grabs you by the throat with it 's stunning cinematography , you just know that you have stumbled upon a treat , masterpiece of a film . Although with most modern movies , extremely enjoyable as some are , those that really shock you into focus are the strongest , and are the ones that are most critically acclaimed and mostly , stick with you for a life time . I say , proudly , that I am a fan of movies that disturb , not just horror movies , but those that send a vibe laden with foreboding . Movies like Breakdown and The Missing , that send a chill down your spine , making you think `` holy crap , that could happen to me '' , and visually entice you , are up there with some of my favorite aspects in a movie . Because I am only 21 , I did not grow up with actors like Burt Renyolds , Jon Voight and Ned Beatty , albeit I am familiar with them , I did n't watch them grow and proceed as actors , as opposed to actors now like Shia LaBouf and Justin Long . I must say , after the long hype and witnessing Deliverance for the first time , I was so admired by these veteran actors in a movie made more than 30 years ago , and still lives it 's terror up in competition to modern movies . Burt Renyolds plays Lewis , the macho self appointed leader of a group of four friends on a canoe trip down a fictitious river before a dam is made , filling the whole wilderness in water . Renyolds ' character is an experienced adventurer , sort of no nonsense , and filled with machismo . Witnessing him portray the tough guy , made me think differently about him as an actor , as i have only seen him as a seedy old guy or an angry politician . The dialog the director provides for his character gives him enough malice to be proved as a strong and even intimidating leader . Ronny Cox and Ned Beatty play as the novice adventurers , Drew and Bob respectively , joining in for the fun of a canoe trip . The actor that i thoroughly enjoyed watching was Jon Voight , once again I have only seen him as an older actor , however , unlike Renyolds , I have quite liked Voight 's acting ( and i do n't regard Anaconda when I say that ) , for example the national treasure movies . Voight plays Ed , whom , like Lewis , is experienced in adventuring but is seen as a more reserved character , a reluctant hero/ leader and definitely lacks Lewis ' machismo . The film basically opens up with the four driving into a small town while asking to find someone to drive their cars to the bottom of the river whilst they canoe the rapids and camp along the riverside . You immediately get a creepy vibe from the hillbilly characters we are introduced to , like the imbred kid who plays the infamous `` Duelling Banjo 's '' at the start of the film with Ronny Cox 's character Drew ; and more so the two mountain men in the films pivotal and disturbing rape scene . As with all atmospheric movies , from this moment on , dread and confusion fills the characters as well as the audience and it is here we see the characters take shape and change form . The canoe trip that follows is expertly shot and it is from here the men fight against both human and nature 's odds for survival . The film 's cinematics do not let up , and I back that comment up with the scene in which Ed fights one of the rapist mountain men with a composite bow . As Ed falls on to one of his arrows and notices his enemy approaching him , cocks his rifle , only to shoot the floor as he falls with an arrow in his neck ; was possible the greatest piece of cinematic shooting I have seen in a film . In wrapping up , Deliverance is one film , who 's dread and atmosphere carry the mood across and to this date , remains one of the best films in cinematic history .
While rehearing Carmen of Bizet , the middle-aged choreographer Antonio ( Antonio Gades ) brings the sexy Carmen ( Laura del Sol ) to perform the lead role . Antonio falls in love for Carmen , who is an independent and seductive woman incapable to accept a possessive love . When Carmen has an affair with another dancer , Antonio is consumed by his jealousy like D. José in the original opera , entwining fiction with reality . `` Carmen '' is another great movie of Carlos Saura 's trilogy dedicated to the Flamenco dance . The dramatic love story is developed with the lives of the artists entwined with the characters they are rehearsing , and many times is not absolutely clear whether what is happening is reality ( with the dancers ) or fiction ( of the play ) . Paco de Lucia is another attraction of this original version of the famous Bizet 's opera , which is based on the novel of Prosper Mérimée . My vote is seven . Title ( Brazil ) : `` Carmen ''
Tarzan and Jane are living happily in the jungle . Some men come looking for ivory and to take Jane back to civilization . But Jane loves Tarzan and refuses to leave . One of the men falls in love with Jane and is determined to take her back ... even if that means killing Tarzan . This is a rarity -- a sequel that 's better than the original . `` Tarzan , the Ape Man '' of 1932 was good but had some dreadful special effects and sort of dragged . This one has MUCH better effects and is a lot more adult . There is tons of blatant racism ( a black man is shot to death point blank -- and no one really cares ) but this was 1934 . There 's also plenty of blood , gore and violence ( for a 1934 movie ) and uncut prints have Jane doing a lengthy underwater swim totally nude ! There 's also obvious sexual content and Tarzan and Jane are wearing next to nothing and ( it 's implied ) they sleep together and have sex -- without being married . This would n't bother anyone today but in 1934 this was pretty extreme . That aside , the movie is well-directed , very fast-moving and full of adventure and excitement . Seeing Weissmuller in that skimpy lion cloth is certainly a treat for the eyes and Jane 's outfit is pretty revealing too . I still think Maureen O'Sullivan is bad as Jane but Weismuller is perfect as Tarzan . Everybody else is OK . This is easily the best Weismuller -- O'Hara Tarzan out there . WELL worth seeing but not for kids !
This is a great movie for all Generation X'ers . What a different world the America of 1972 was compared to our psychotic 21st Century . You can get a sense of what an 1972 America gone by was like by watching this movie . I found that the clothing and the car styles brought back to me fond memories of a much better country than we have now . Just think ... back then there were only 4 or 5 TV stations to choose from . There was no AIDS , Muslim terrorists , Road Rage , 911 , Bird Flu , Freeway Snipers , etc , etc . The Vietnam war was just over . There will still be 7 years before Star Wars comes out . The personal computer and internet would still be 29 years away . When this movie first came out the producers had to market the film themselves as no other film company wanted it . So it began touring small Protestant churches around the country being shown on movie projectors ( This was the days before VCRS of course ) . The pastor of a church who would would be interested in showing A Thief in the NIght to his congregation would obtain a copy of the film . Then he would set up a evening to show it in the church meeting area or lunch room . Members of the congregation would invite `` unsaved '' friends and family members and it would be a social event of the week . If you can get past the limited production values of the film and just watch it for its nostalgic value , then I think you will enjoy the film more . Of course I am speaking as a gen xer . If I had a time machine I would go back to 1972 and say goodbye to the 21st century cesspool we have now .
Kabei : Our Mother ( 2008 ) is a poetic and sublime beauty from Japan . A real weeper ! I had heard great reviews for the film and rented it from Netflix . Am I glad I did ! In many ways this film reminded me of the old style of Japanese classic film-making from the 1940 's and 1950 's that I 've come to love so much , such as seen in Yasujiro Ozu pictures -- the title credits even begin in the same way , with the Japanese letters ( characters ) in red against neutral color burlap material . I immediately thought : this director loves Ozu . The same style was used too : mostly indoor sets with only a few outdoor scenes . Even a couple of `` pillow shots '' , as Roger Ebert calls them . The strength of the film is built on the love of the characters for one another . The story follows the lives of a Japanese family before , and during , and after , World War Two . The mother takes care of her growing girls the best she can after the father ( a University professor ) is arrested for anti-war sympathies . He 's never freed and only has a few brief meetings with his wife in prison before he dies of starvation and disease . Meanwhile a former student of the professor comes by often to help take care of the mother and two girls . He begins to fall in love with the mother and is a substitute father for the two girls . But war starts and he 's drafted and they have to say an abrupt farewell . Will they ever express their love for one another ? Will he ever return from the war ? There is so much heart and gentle spirit in the performance of the lead actress , Sayuri Yoshinaga . She 's almost a Madonna type , she 's so beautiful ! Big soulful eyes and flawless skin . The actor who plays the student is phenomenal as well : his name is Tadanobu Asano . What a sensitive performance . There is no macho in him at all ; he 's gentle and kind . I 'd certainly love to see both of these two in other movies . I think I 'll check to see what 's available for them . The two little child actresses are wonderful too . The film is just released on NTSC DVD for American audiences , with very easy to read English subtitles . I gave it a 10 out of 10 on the IMDb . I cried almost as much as with the Japanese film classic Twenty-Four Eyes ( 1954 ) . Do n't miss this film !
I thought the whole movie played out beautifully with fresh images and interesting cinematography the whole way through it . The actors were on top of their character 's backs in nearly perfect timing and looked great . The music was lush and well-thought-out . It even had a decent twist of an ending . So what 's with everyone voting it down ? The story was n't entirely fresh ( felt like a remnant of `` Running Man '' with the whole television show idea ) , but the attitude towards Christianity and Judaism about how the public picks their Messiah certainly sounded true enough . It made sense to follow this one man who was put before a modern crowd and to put him on a pedestal because of his opportunity . It 's possible that Christians or other religious people pick this up because the movie has the word `` God '' in it , but that shows what the filmmakers were trying to do is to teach a possibility to people who maybe never saw the world like this , especially in the modern world where Christianity has been more and more accepted and forgotten about by some . I gave it a 7/10 stars here on IMDb . I thought every ounce of the movie was entertaining and original , for the most-part . Check it out if you 're not too offended to see an entertaining film from Madrid , Spain , about possibilities of the coming modern Messiah to a TV near you .
From the first scene , I was really excited . `` I can tell this is going to be awesome ! '' I thought . The acting was so good , I felt as though I was eaves-dropping on these peoples ' lives . The music too was exquisitely unsettling . The plot started with a sudden event and then drifted forward ( one could sense ) toward some irrevocable fate . The build was slow , but I personally love that kind of thing , as long as the quiet tension stays on track and does n't get derailed before it 's ready to pay off . So everything 's going fine , and then the fireworks begin , and before you know it , the credits are rolling . `` WHAT ? ! ! ! '' was all I and my movie-night companion could say . If you understand the director 's intentions , the blunt ending does make sense ( for those of you who have seen the movie already , check out the very fascinating and hilarious interview with Larry Fessenden at filmcritic.com ) , but I ca n't help saying it was not pulled off quite right . This probably could have been resolved with as little as ten more minutes of material before the climax . In any case , it 's too bad . Those ten minutes could have made all the difference in the world . ( But for those of you who do n't write or make films , you should know that crafting a story arc with the proper timing is a HUGE pain in the butt , and I am certainly not making this critique from any kind of pedestal ! ) Wendigo feels to me like a masterpiece that was given up on before it was finished . But hay , I 'd take a blunted masterpiece any day over an over-produced piece of dog-poo over-compensated with too many digital effects ( like most horror movies these days ) . One other comment . Some of the monster scenes left me confused as to whether I should be scared or laughing . I do n't know how to explain it , but there was a distinctively Monty Python feel about this monster in his more blatent `` monster '' forms . Although this may sound like a terrible criticism for a horror movie -- I do n't know , it still worked for me in some crooked way . I will never look at deer antlers in the same way again ! : )
Sure , the plot is n't Oldboy . It seems the only `` great '' movies these days are amazingly shocking or high-budget/hyped in some way . Spin Kick is a drama/comedy about a group of people who decide to pour their hearts into tae kwon do . Regardless of what you expect from this film , you 're guaranteed to feel moved by the work , pain , and expectations that the characters force themselves to experience . Though comedic at times , many moments and characters are rendered beautifully : there 's the old guard character who takes things too seriously , the hoodlum turned good-guy who just wants a second chance at life , the meek team-substitute who would die happy if he just won once in his life , and many other well-rounded characters with their own problems -- but most importantly , their own their hopes and dreams . While the plot and the goals of the movie are simple , these aspects of the movie merely highlight the development of the characters as they overcome their personal and inter-personal struggles . In short , this film will leave you feeling fresh , determined , and satisfied .
`` Kalifornia '' is a good Hollywoodish odyssey of suspense and terror which tells of two couples who drive cross-country to California to share the cost of gas : A pair of losers ( Lewis & Pitt ) and two wannabee artists , a photographer and a writer ( Duchovny & Forbes ) . Pitt `` nails '' his character which is the focus of this somewhat predictable thriller . A good watch for those into psycho-killer flix .
This is a very exciting and romantic film . I have seen it several times and never get bored with it . Everything is realistic and it is a good plot . The actors are excellent Liam Neeson , Jessica Lange , Tim Roth and Brian Cox . I actually prefer this film to Braveheart as Braveheart contain so many historical misstakes . There is many exciting scenes - watch out for the Bridge Scen and the last fencing scene . This is really good and surprising scenes . The music are lovely ... it really suits to the movie . The setting is amazing .
This is one of the greatest love story movies I have ever seen . Yes , I can agree that some parts may seem dated , but this does not distract from the film . One should try to observe , criticize and enjoy any art form from the perspective of the time . Clearly by the `` Sex in the City '' standards , Charlie Chaplin was horribly boring . However , when judged from the prospective of 1925 America , he was fantastic . Likewise Sayonara is a breakthrough film in its look into a mixed-race love affair , American `` manifest destiny '' arrogance and prejudice , and the complexity of different cultures . It is a natural next step to such films as Gentleman 's Agreement . Its purpose , however , was not just social commentary , rather , it is entertaining and enjoyable , with innumerable lines that one just does n't forget . However , even when taken only as a love story , it is terrific . Although , some attack Brando 's accent , he is at his near best in nuance and characterization . Buttons and Umeki ( who both won Oscars ) and the rest of the supporting cast add much to the film . Taka , the real star , does a fabulous job making you feel the passion she has for Brando , while being torn by her sense of obligation and loyalty . Her speech when she first meets and speaks with Brando is a classic and something rarely if ever matched in cinema . The dialog between Taka and Brando in her dressing room in Tokyo at the film 's end is equally good . Of course , it does n't have the mouth-sucking , spit-swapping and worse , that exemplifies love in today 's movies , but that makes it all the better . It portrays true love and passion , and not just `` heat . '' If this movie does n't touch you , then you are just too young , too cynical or dead .
THE BEAVER TRILOGY is , without a doubt , one of the most brilliant films ever made . I was lucky enough to catch it , along with a Q & A session with director Trent Harris , at the NY Video Festival a few years back and then bought a copy off of Trent 's website . This movie HAS to be seen to be believed ! I sincerely recommend searching for Trent 's name on the web and then buying the film from his site . He 's an incredibly nice guy to boot . Do n't get confused : The cameraman in the fictional sections of THE BEAVER TRILOGY is NOT Trent ! After having seen the TRILOGY a few times , I do have to admit that I could probably do without the Sean Penn version . It 's like a try-out version for the Crispin Glover `` Orkly Kid '' section and is interesting more as a curiosity item if you 're a Penn fan than it being a good video . Penn is pretty funny , though , and you can see the makings of a big star in this gritty B & W video . This is probably also one of Crispin Glover 's best roles and I would just love to see an updated documentary about the original Groovin ' Gary . Once you see this film , you 'll never get Gary 's nervous laughter out of your head ever again .
I 'm still new to the Krimi genre and the only one I 've seen prior to seeing this one was the earlier and somewhat disappointing 'The Dead Eyes of London ' , which did n't exactly inspire a great hope for the rest of the genre in me . If I 'd seen this one first , however , the feeling would have been different as while The College Girl Murders is a bizarre and rather wacky attempt at a crime flick ; it 's great fun to watch and it 's really hard to hate a film that throws so many weird and wonderful ideas into the script and manages to pull it off with style . The film begins in a lab where a crazy scientist has invented a new and highly toxic poison that kills its victim and makes it look like they died from a heart attack . This poison is used by a mysterious criminal mastermind who breaks common criminals out of jail to carry out his murders using this poison ( and then has them put back in jail ) . As the title suggests , it 's a nearby college full of girls that provides most of the victims . There 's also a mysterious monk dressed in a red robe who marauds around breaking necks with a bullwhip . Of course , with a plot like that ; this is not exactly a serious affair and the director clearly knows that as there is a very tongue-in-cheek vibe to the film , which does bode well with the plot . The fact that there are so many different sides to the plot does unfortunately mean that everything does not run smoothly ; although this is n't a big problem as things are kept ticking over nicely throughout the film and there 's always enough going on to keep the audience interested . The atmosphere is superb and the colour scheme on display is great too look at . Of course , the film is based on an Edgar Wallace novel and clearly the man has a great imagination ; the locations used are also superb and while a killer 's lair decked out with a host of wild and exotic animals might not serve any relevance to the plot , it does help to give the film that extra 'something ' . You cant expect a conclusion that fully makes sense after all the stuff that goes on in this film ; but the reason for the murders sort of makes sense and is a satisfying way for the film to climax . Overall , College Girl Murders is an excellent little mystery flick and one that comes highly recommended !
I saw this in the theater and I instantly thought that it is good enough to own on video . I am a big nut for Sci-Fi action flicks though anyway . Without giving any of the story away , it is worth seeing if you like Sci-Fi without requiring much thought . The story is basic , and the plot is very good . Worth your time to see ! Maybe they will make a sequel ? : ) 8 out of 10
This very funny British comedy shows what might happen if a section of London , in this case Pimlico , were to declare itself independent from the rest of the UK and its laws , taxes & post-war restrictions . Merry mayhem is what would happen . The explosion of a wartime bomb leads to the discovery of ancient documents which show that Pimlico was ceded to the Duchy of Burgundy centuries ago , a small historical footnote long since forgotten . To the new Burgundians , however , this is an unexpected opportunity to live as they please , free from any interference from Whitehall . Stanley Holloway is excellent as the minor city politician who suddenly finds himself leading one of the world 's tiniest nations . Dame Margaret Rutherford is a delight as the history professor who sides with Pimlico . Others in the stand-out cast include Hermione Baddeley , Paul Duplis , Naughton Wayne , Basil Radford & Sir Michael Hordern . Welcome to Burgundy !
This is my favorite movie EVER . I have watched it at least 10 times and I cry every time . My family begs me not to watch it so I wont have a crying fit . I think I love that it is a true story written by Antwone himself just as much as I love the movie . The acting is top notch , and the actors were perfect for their role . Denzel Washington is one of my favorite actors . But this is my favorite movie he has done so far . I took care of a little boy who was also born in jail . He was the most precious little boy I had ever met . He has now been adopted by a wonderful family who fought for him for almost two years . I saw this movie while the fight was still going on and his future was unsure and I am so happy he is safe and loved . And I am so happy Antwone 's happy and found his family . I would love to know more about him and how it has been since meeting his family . I just cant say enough good things about it ! !
You do not get more dark or tragic than `` Othello '' and this movie captures the play fairly well , with outstanding performances by Lawrence Fishburne and Irene Jacob . Fishburne 's expresses to the viewer Othello 's torment as he falls prey to Iago 's lies very convincingly , even providing a realistic epileptic episode . Jacob is the loving and loyal wife who becomes either the instrument of Iago 's revenge against Othello , or the object of his wrath ( it is not clear which since no motive for Iago 's behavior is offered ) . Although Kenneth Brannagh ( sp ? ) displays his usual talent for Shakespeare in this movie , he is somewhat marginalized . The characters of Cassio and Emilia also wander in and out of scenes even though they , like Iago , seem more crucial to the plot . I have not checked the movie against the play to see how many lines were cut out , but I know that Shakespeare tends to develop his characters , even the seemingly unimportant ones , very well . If I had any criticism of the movie it would be that the story unfolds too quickly , and that the relationships between some of the characters are not laid out more . The director had a great cast , and no one offered a bad performance . The relationship between Cassio and Othello and that between Emilia and Desdemona need to be further developed earlier in the film . I have a feeling that they were closer to each other than the movie suggests , although you get a sense of this very late into the movie . Also , Othello and Desdemona need more time together . Although their anguish is convincing , the amount of interaction they have with each other makes it seem like they just met . On the other hand , maybe the did just meet -- -like Romeo and Juliet . In brief : good performances , too short .
Having never seen the original Dirty Harry , I judged this movie on a clean slate . And I must say , I quite enjoyed it . Sure , some of the acting by Sondre Locke made me a little squeemish - but hey , it was the 80 's . But even if you ca n't get past her ( and I almost could n't ) or her revenge killings ( which seemed a little.. overdone ; P ) , it 's worth it just for Dirty Harry . Or at the very least , the bull dog he affectionately names 'MeatHead ' : P 7/10 .
Eva ( Hedy Lamarr ) has just got married with an older man and in the honeymoon , she realizes that her husband does not desire her . Her disappointment with the marriage and the privation of love , makes Eva returning to her father 's home in a farm , leaving her husband . One afternoon , while bathing in a lake , her horse escapes with her clothes and an young worker retrieves and gives them back to Eva . They fall in love for each other and become lovers . Later , her husband misses her and tries to have Eva back home . Eva refuses , and fortune leads the trio to the same place , ending the affair in a tragic way . I have just watched `` Extase '' for the first time , and the first remark I have is relative to the horrible quality of the VHS released in Brazil by the Brazilian distributor Video Network : the movie has only 75 minutes running time , and it seems that it was used different reels of film . There are some parts totally damaged , and other parts very damaged . Therefore , the beauty of the images in not achieved by the Brazilian viewer , if he has a chance to find this rare VHS in a rental or for sale . The film is practically a silent movie , the story is very dated and has only a few lines . Consequently , the characters are badly developed . However , this movie is also very daring , with the exposure of Hedy Lamarr beautiful breasts and naked fat body for the present standards of beauty . Another fantastic point is the poetic and metaphoric used of flowers , symbolizing the intercourse between Eva and her lover . The way the director conducts the scenes to show the needs and privation of Eva is very clear . The non-conclusive end is also very unusual for a 1933 movie . I liked this movie , but I hope one day have a chance to see a 87 minutes restored version . My vote is eight . Title ( Brazil ) : `` Êxtase '' ( `` Ecstasy '' )
This was a fine example of how an interesting film can be made without using big stars and big effects . Just tell a true story about the struggles of two African American women over a turbulent century . This movie challenges us all to look at our own personal prejudices and see that people are people , not white , black , etc . Good movie with a good message .
Just like wine , `` Johnny Dangerously '' gets better and better with every day . This clever , witty , well-acted film could very well stand on its own - but as a parody of the gangster genre , it 's truly outstanding . In fact , it 's quite obviously the best film of its kind ... the funniest spoof of mob movies and even the respective period - although , admittedly , this position is probably easier to achieve when its main competitors are such primitive , vulgar and dull pseudocomedies as `` Jane Austen 's Mafia '' .
It was in 1988 , when I saw `` The Ronnie and Nancy Show '' for the first time ( on Austrian television ) . At that time , I was already a very big fan of Spitting Image ( since when it won the bronze rose of the Montreux Film Festival in 1986 ) . Of course I recorded every show on tape and watched it again and again - especially `` The Ronnie and Nancy Show '' . I remember that scene when Ronnie stood in front of a painting of Abraham Lincoln ( thinking it was a mirror ) and said to himself `` I need a shave '' . Or most amusing of all , when he played ball with his dog - but vice-versa ! It 's such a shame , that Spitting Image seems to fall into oblivion ; it was one of the most fantastic and most intelligent made TV-shows ever . Compared to other satirical broadcasts it was definitely the best of all . Well , almost 20 years have passed since then , and I wish I could see the show again . Is it possible to purchase it from someone ... somewhere ?
Oscar-caliber performance by Peter Falk in an Oscar-caliber-written role . I loved the nuanced , balanced exploration of a long-time marriage - how often do we get that in films , where usually the movie ends when boy & girl get together ? This is a movie for adults , a complex view through the eyes of all parties - husband , wife , son - how each have adapted to each other in the past and grow during the story . On top of that , it gave me about 10 major belly laughs , and I 'm one of those people who usually sits unamused when the rest of an audience is laughing . This was one of the few truly funny movies I 've seen . Great , original jokes .
of the films of the young republic few in number as they are The Buccaneer ( 1958 ) stands out as a finely crafted film . Charleton Heston excels in his portrayal of Old Hickory 's defence of New Orleans with a thrown together force of militia , regulars and pirates promised a reprieve . after Christmas 1814 peninsula veterans led by sir edward packenham , the duke of wellington 's brother in law bore down on the city of new orleans . andy jackson had a day to draw together a scratch force to defend the city behind bales of hay . Charlton Heston projects Jackson 's terrifying presence and awe inspiring power of command . Yet there are a few colorful comic relief . With the might of the English lioness about to pounce , a young blond haired voluteer from New Orleans asks : I guess the ruckus is about to start . the battle was about to rage but not for long . true to form the British marched straight into withering American fire . in less than a few minutes an attempt to reconquer lost north American territories had been foiled . the battle scene in this movies lasts slightly longer than the actual battle itself . there are colorful side stories in this film of the young volunteer at his first dance to celebrate the victory .
As a fan of looking further into the phenomenon that is school shootings , this film took an interesting and different approach to the idea . Presented as a series of video recordings made by the two troubled men ( I can not refer to persons who kill as boys or teens ) , the months of preparation leading to zero day ( the codename for the day on which they will attack ) the film tries to present the situation from the opposite end of the gun . It seems intent on portraying the pain they suffer , yet focuses on the literal preparation . The problem is that little in terms of emotion is directly delivered . The only point at which emotion became overwhelming was the ending , as expected . But leading up to this point , it 's never really clear as to why they are planning this out . We are told the obligatory story that they were mocked , but the film also seems to contradict this . Without ruining the film , it 's easy to say it was a great attempt and had equally great intentions , but falls short because of sloppy film-making . All directing is amateur , to further the homemade video concept , but the story and continuity is weak . The film seems to want the audience to decide a lot , but also fails to provide the information for such an event . The ending is abrupt , and does n't feel like it finishes everything that the film began .
French film directors continue to amaze with their extraordinary ability to simulate the sights and sounds of ordinary , everyday suburban life . This was readily apparent with the release early in 2002 of L'Emploi du temps ( Time Out ) , a brilliant character study of of a white collar worker 's descent into melancholy after having been fired from his job . As is the penchant of French filmmakers , many scenes were shot on real streets and in public places , giving a cinema verite feel to the story , yet L'Emploi du temps also possessed an elegant look thanks to excellent camera work and some stunning location footage ( most notably a Swiss mountain retreat ) . Running fairly on the heels of that masterful movie comes another impressive French production , Jacques Audiard 's gritty crime caper , Sur mes levres ( Read My Lips ) . Actually , to tag this film a crime caper does it a disservice because it is so much more than that . As with the earlier French release , it is an incisive character study of marginal people using their wits to get ahead in a society that has turned its back on them . In a Paris construction firm Carla , a shy , diminutive young woman sits at her desk , sequestered to an area of the office that is a major pathway to the xerox machines and restrooms . Obnoxious coworkers use the front of Carla 's desk to chat and drop off their half-finished Styrofoam cups of coffee . Partially deaf , Carla turns her hearing aids on and off at will if noise becomes bothersome , be it the drone of the paper copiers or the shrill crying of a friend 's baby . When her boss calls her into the office to suggest that she hire a secretarial assistant to help her with the work load , Carla fears she may lose her job . At the employment office Carla lists the specifications she wants for her assistant ( preferably male ) as if she were at a Personals Agency . He should be 25 years old and clean -cut , with extensive computer and filing skills . When the agency sends over an unkempt , menacing looking young man , Carla is both shocked and intrigued . They leave the office and have lunch at a local eatery , where Carla interviews her prospective assistant . When she finds out that he has just gotten out of prison , Carla initially wants nothing to do with Paul , but has a change of heart and hires him on . Although she is basically kind toward her helper , Carla now finds herself in a position of authority and possessing a newfound sense of power . Paul learns quickly and becomes an able worker . Carla helps Paul find a temporary place to live and even covers for him when his parole officer shows up one day at the office wondering why Paul missed his appointment . During one of their lunch breaks Carla informs Paul of her hearing deficiency and reveals her ability to read lips . Later , when an avaricious coworker blatantly takes over a project Carla has been working on , a furious Carla asks Paul 's help in seeking revenge on the man . From here on in Sur mes levres becomes an increasingly intense crime drama escalating into some of the most violently graphic scenes that have been shown on the screen in recent years . The screenplay borrows elements from Hitchcock , most notably REAR WINDOW , where Carla 's lip-reading talent comes into full play using a pair of binoculars . There is a teasing , on-again , off-again sexual attraction between the two protagonists that culminates in a rather strange homage to NORTH BY NORTHWEST , but it works because of the considerable sexual heat that builds slowly between the two stars . That being said , what one carries away from this movie is n't so much the similarities to classic Hitchcock thrillers , although those elements are definitely there , but the pervasive view a of a modern day city ( in this case Paris ) where life runs the gamut from mundane workdays to a boozy , garish nightlife where sex , drugs and laundered money infiltrate the lives of several characters . Unlike Hollywood productions , this is a psychological suspense yarn where the people look like the everyday man and woman on the street , where a punch in the face or groin sounds like a sickening thud and where the office is a place to be feared . It 's Hitchcock with the gloves off .
The quintessential road movie ... if your idea of a road movie involves three would-be magicians with Eastern European accents and Claire Forlani . ( Well , one out of four ai n't bad ... ) A no-talent magician with an eye for showmanship ( Max ) watches a very skilled pickpocket ( Hugo ) plying his trade in New York . After convincing Hugo that he ( Max ) is a ) mental and b ) desperately in need of a partner to make his dreams of being a stage magician come alive , the not-so-dynamic duo enlist the managerial expertise of an inventor of illusions ( Milo ) and the , ah , gentler attributes of a lovely waitress ( Lydia ) . The unlikely four pile into a van ( obtained by Hugo ... you guess where it came from ) and head to Vegas . Havoc ensues . Anyhow , it 's funny , it 's well-written , and the ending is surprisingly good . A solid comedy with a warm heart , and all the better that it was totally unexpected .
This documentary was interesting , but it was also long ( so long it lasts a total of 225 minutes ) , like Ben-Hur long . But if your into that , this is for you . But only if you have a passion for movies , like I do . Being that Martin Scorsese is my favorite director ( live and maybe even ever ) , this is quite fascinating , especially if you know the style of Scorsese 's works . Because then you can understand where he got his inspiration for many of his films . Not the best documentary film ever made , but it is a leap for Scorsese , which is always good to watch . A
ROAD TO PERDITION can be summed up by Thomas Newman 's score . It 's haunting and beautiful but you 're aware that this music is similar to Newman 's other work and while listening to the soundtrack you 're reminded of SCENT OF A WOMAN , MEETING JOE BLACK and THE SHAWSHANK REDEMPTION you 're reminded of other films as the story unfolds on screen . As the Sullivans drive round America trying to escape from a psychotic hit man you think of THE GETAWAY , Irish gangsters is MILLER 'S CROSSING whilst the subtext of guilt and redemption can be summed up by Coppola and Leone 's gangster epics . Despite having a seen it all before feel this should n't be taken as a heavy criticism of Sam Mendes film which I repeat is haunting and beautiful and the only flaws that work against it is a very slow opening twenty minutes and I was slightly confused as the events that caused Michael Sullivan to be betrayed . But if you stop to consider how much of a sentimental mess Spielberg might have made with the story that revolves around a father and his twelve year old son running for their lives you ca n't help thinking what a superb director Mendes is ROAD TO PERDITION is a film where the entire cast give flawless performances . I 've never been all that keen on Tom Hanks but he 's every bit as good here as he has been in any starring role , probably better . Paul Newman plays a character with an Irish accent but at no point did I believe I was watching an American screen legend putting on a false accent - Newman 's performance works due to the subtle body language , his character is torn up by guilt but Newman never milks it or goes over the top . While never upstaging Newman who gives the best performance in the movie the two Brit supporting actors Craig and Law are also very memorable as American gangsters and while Law will still have a long career as a leading actor one wonders how Daniel Craig might have progressed as a character actor if he had n't decided to become James Bond , a role which heralds the end of an actors career
Vivah is by no means a classic . However in the days of hardcore action , path-breaking special effects & complex plots ( none of which Bollywood has mastered yet ) , its quite refreshing to see a simple film like Vivah . The story as we all know is a journey from a couple 's first meeting to their eventual wedding after some coy moments and testing times . Nothing more , nothing less . The music is n't quite in the same league as MPK or HAHK but does n't jar your senses either . Two songs stood out for me - Mujhe Haq Hai & Do Anjaane . While Milan abhi aadha & Hamaari shaadi were hummable . Shahid performs sincerely & shows a lot of potential . Its good to see him play something else but the `` cool dude '' he normally does . Amrita is very sweet and plays the role of a docile small-town girl to perfection . Alok Nath , Anupam Kher & Seema Biswas are terrific supports and the rest of the cast does a reasonable job . Suraj 's direction is simple but effective . The movie 's prime flaw is the slow pace which might test the patience of a lot of young viewers . But all in all a good , clean , decent family movie .
Moonwalker by Michael Jackson is a real adventure film for the whole family ! Before the real story of the movie starts , we get a performance of the Bad Tour ( Man In The Mirror ) , and it kicks off a great movie . After that we get a kind of a collage of Michael carrier , as it was until Moonwalker came out in 1988 . After a few Music Videos also ( Speed Demon , Leave Me Alone , etc . ) the story starts . The plot is basically that Michael and his 3 friends ( who are kids ) are being chased by the bad guy of the story `` Mr. Big '' , because they discovered his evil plans of getting children all over the world hocked on drugs . During the chase we see fantastic segments , fx . Michaels video for Smooth Criminal , which is absolutely fantastic with its dance sequences , etc . But then one of the kids get kidnapped by Mr. Big , and Michael will haft to save her before she gets a drug addict . During the movie we see special effects not only amazing for those days standards , but also impressive today . For instance , see Michael turning in to a robot/spaceship in order to protect his friends ! It 's so cool ! The movie ends with a performance of Come Together ( later published in Michaels double-album of HIStory ) , and you leave the movie with a magic feeling . Amazing ! I recommend this for every family who wants to spend a nice night together with candy and popcorn in front of the TV . And now some parents might stand up and say : `` But Michael Jackson is an alleged child abuser ! '' Yeah , he is indeed , but , come on , we all know it is n't true ! Wait and see..
This was a hit in the South By Southwest ( SXSW ) Film festival in Austin last year , and features a fine cast headed up by E.R . 's Gloria Reuben , and a scenery-chewing John Glover . Though shot on a small budget in NYC , the film looks and sounds fabulous , and takes us on a behind the scenes whirl through the rehearsal and mounting of what actors call `` The Scottish Play , '' as a reference to the word `` Macbeth '' is thought to bring on the play 's ancient curse . The acting company exhibits all the emotions of the play itself , lust , jealousy , rage , suspicion , and a bit of fun as well . The games begin when an accomplished actor is replaced ( in the lead role ) by a well-known `` pretty face '' from the TV soap opera scene in order to draw bigger crowds . The green-eyed monster takes over from there , and the drama unfolds nicely . Fine soundtrack , and good performances all around . The DVD includes director 's commentary and some deleted scenes as well .
This is a great movie . Some will disagree with me but , if you know anything about the bible you know it is . I think everyone should see it ! ! I agree a new updated version like be nice but the message is still right on . If you can see this movie . Is not a `` scare the hell of you movie '' , it is truthful with the Bible . I think the U. N. will play a major role in the world government to come . The last days are lining up with the Bible . Look at what has happened with the chip for dogs and cats that now has come to light to protect on children from being kidnapped . It 's the size of a grain of rice . This I feel is the fore runner of the mark of the beast spoken of in the Bible . Without the mark you ca n't sell or buy , with this chip that small in the future there is no telling how much info can be put on it .
I never saw it on TV but rented the DVD through Netflix as soon as I found that it was available . I had high expectations , and was not disappointed . It 's funny , and the animation is excellent . That level of quality I would only have expected from feature films , so I 'm surprised at some of the bad comments on it . Maybe the DVD release had improved animation ? One bonus to the DVD is that it was fun to see both versions of the pilot . I 'm an adult , and I really appreciate that it is for adults . It is n't only kids who like cute animated characters . It is nowhere near `` raunchy '' as some have claimed , but I can see where some parents would n't want their young children to see it . I 'm very disappointed that it was cancelled . I wish they would produce more episodes . Or perhaps a movie .
Elmer Fudd is laughing while lounging in his easy chair and reading his comic book , his dog comfortably nearby sleeping in front of the fireplace . All is peaceful until a flea comes bouncing by . ( The flea is dressed in a farmer's-type outfit with a big sombrero and is carrying a satchel with the name `` A. Flea '' on it . ) He gets out his telescope and spots the dog . ( We see a big shot of the dog 's butt and the flea whistles in excitement , screaming `` T- Bone ! '' He then sings , `` There 's food around the corner ; there 's food around the corner ! '' ) That sets up the storyline of this cute-but-obnoxious flea tormenting the poor dog . The mutt is hilarious as he reacts to the flea . The drawings of his huge teeth chomping right next to the fleeing flea are clever and the dog 's dialog made me laugh out loud a few times . This might be the funniest canine I have ever seen in a cartoon ! The poor pooch , under a threat of having to take a bath , as to NOT react when the stupid flea causes him pain . It 's almost painful to watch as the flea uses pickaxes , jackhammers and the like on the dog . He puts firecrackers in the dog 's behind . It 's brutal !
While I do n't consider myself a big fan of fairy tale movies , Stardust intrigued me based on seeing Michelle Pfeiffer in the trailers as a villain ( especially since I was about to see her as the bossy Velma Von Tussle in Hairspray ) . Boy , is she so convincingly evil here as a witch , especially with her age-ugly makeup in the beginning and end ! Robert De Niro is also great as the pirate captain who 's forced to hide `` in the closet '' to protect his `` reputation '' ! Just about all the actors like Claire Danes , Rupert Everett , Ricky Gervais , Peter O'Toole and many others do fine work here . While Danes and Pfeiffer are classic beauties , there 's also stunning faces of Sienna Miller , Olivia Grant ( as Girl Bernard ) , and Kate Magowan especially when we first meet her . Newcomer Charlie Cox is fine as the lead Tristan and he looked so much like his father Dunstan as a young man that I thought that was him in early scenes with Magowan ( actually Ben Barnes ) . Many comments have compared this to The Princess Bride and while I can see some resemblances , the main difference was that with PB , you always knew it was just an imaginary tale as told by an old man to his grandson . Stardust makes you believe , for the most part , that what you 're seeing and hearing could have actually happened even with all the hilarity that happens throughout . So on that note , I highly recommended Stardust .
I remember the first time I saw this movie -- I was in the office working over the weekend & the TV was on for background noise . But I gradually found myself more & more engaged in this movie I 'd never seen or heard of , until I was completely absorbed . A Matter of Life & Death ( the British title -- Stairway to Heaven in the US ) is delightful , compelling , whimsical , & moving , all in one superbly-written , well-acted , perfectly-directed package . It 's a classic that really does rank right up there with Casablanca , It 's a Wonderful Life , Gone With the Wind , Citizen Kane , & Chariots of Fire . WHY has it never received the same public notice & video-store prominence ? Fortunately , SOME knowledgeable critics HAVE put it on their `` Top 100 of all time '' lists . There IS hope -- 1940 's Fantasia was n't a hit 'til the '60s , & the Wizard of Oz was a dud at the box office , but made a hit by TV . Buy it -- rent it -- watch it -- demand it ! You WO N'T be disappointed !
This started out to be a movie about the street culture of the Bronx in New York . What it accomplished was to give birth to a new culture and way of life , for American youth . What other movie has done this except Rebel Without A Cause ? One of the most important movies of all time . The elements are simple yet fascinating . The story is timeless , young people try to succeed against all odds . Yet the story is always believable and never depressing . The characters are so realistic , a city dweller , would recognize them as neighbors . The story is entertaining , and comes to a satisfying ending . Buy this one for your permanent collection . It is a piece of American history .
The cast is different and now they took a different approach we have the street smart team `` Networth '' vs . the supposed professional team `` Magna '' but boy if you think the street smart team would have trouble you 'd be right . While the Magna team has struggled at times , the street team has simply disintegrated week after week . First some things to reiterate as far as the `` Apprentice 3 '' first of it continues the same absurd mentality ( from Trump ) and the game in this series : if your a good project manager , but you lose , the team will turn on you and you will be fired , despite the fact that your backstabbing teammates are often the ones who do half ass jobs . Simply absurd , that a game show that claims to hire the best candidate actually `` weeds '' out the best while the dysfunctional candidates stab each other until one is left and that person is the best . lol Anyone this season , weve seen a total of cursing , backstabbing and even gay offensive stereotypes carried out as teams try to do campaigns . The list of victims so far Cast Tara Dowdell , Audrey Evans , Danny Kastner those three are the only that I feel were unfairly fired by Trump , the rest really had it coming as they only incited conflict , anger and suffering . It 's just amazing as one candidate Audrey Evans said as how she who did a good job was fired and how some of her worthless teammates are still in the game . Yes its the game , it 's `` The Apprentice '' where manipulation , backstabbing , and always popular `` everyone gang up on the project manager '' mentality rules . It has been an entertaining ride , though , the candidates are given a wide array of assignments from photo shoots to the construction of mini golf courses , to building of new apartments . Still though it 's still the `` Apprentice '' though so all you can do basically is laugh the whole time as the insanity and chaos insues until lucky person is the winner .
May 2004 , Wonderland is fairly new in the UK . Brilliant film of a brutal true story . If you know LA from the early 80 's , you will appreciate how well it is captured . The use of the elements which make up its gritty cinematic style is original , amplifying the experience and bringing the viewer very close to actually being there . The use of a disjointed 'Pulp Fiction ' style time line allows exploration of the uncertainty concerning what really happened , while the direction and performances of the cast command attention , especially Val Kilmer as John Holmes ; an Oscar for sure if I were handing them out .

This movie was good for it 's time . If you like Eddie Murpy this is a must have to add to your collection . Eddie was young and funny with his 80 's haircut . Charlotte Lewis , Eddie 's costar is hot . This was one of her first movies and she was not bad . The graphics were good for the 80 's . A lot of the actors went on to do other good movies you should check them out through IMDb . Other must have from Eddie is `` Coming to America '' and `` 48 hours '' . Another actor `` Victor Wong '' has a small part in this movie . Check out some of his older movies like `` Big trouble in little china '' . If you liked the action movies from the 80 's this is your movie .
Growing up in a multi racial neighborhood back in the 20 's and 30 's , I grew up very close to most of the Italian families living there . This move brought back so many pleasant memories . this is a movie most people would like who enjoy seeing more true to life movies .
Zombie Bloodbath is a movie made by zombie fans for zombie fans with a true love of the Horror genre . As I understand it from the commentary and things I have read , it was made during the huge Midwest flood of 1993 when half of Missouri was underwater . Buildings were under water . cars and houses were underwater . One article said that zombies and the crew from this movie would help sandbag the river after shooting each day . The fact this movie got made at all is a miracle . It is like a huge mashing of every zombie movie ever made put through a Troma filter . It is a party movie to enjoy with friends who like loads of splatter and goofy characters . And it is fast paced and energetic and really funny . A toxic spill accident in a nuclear power facility causes people to melt down or turn into zombies . The local Government covers it up , tears down the factory and builds houses over it . Some ground shifting ( ? ) causes a cave opening to develop and some new residents find the cave and unleash the undead on the newly built community . From there it just gets crazy and gory and fun . I have read these reviews on here a few times . And it seems obvious to me that the same person attacked this fun little movie three times as a different reviewer , using fake names . They use the same words and sentences . Zombie Bloodbath is cheap . It is raw . It has some bad acting . So does half the movies made . There is much much WORSE out there than this fun movie . If you hate this film so much , do n't buy it . There is no need for personal attacks and to call the crew or cast `` Trailer Trash . '' And it is obvious you are not from Australia or England . It is just upsetting that this great service , the IMDb does not catch people using it just to trash others . There are bad reviews and good reviews , and I do n't mind those . I give both bad and good reviews myself . But it is painfully obvious that some fool just wants to use this forum to personally attack the director of this movie . Sad . Some of these so called `` Reviewers '' even basically sue their `` review '' just to promote their own movies . One called this film Boring - well , love it or hate it , one thing you can NEVER say about this film is that it is boring . It moves fast and never has a dull spot . Oh and this reviewer from The Netherlands ? ? ? Um - LIAR . You tried to post this same review at Amazon and it got yanked there . The SAME review only it said it was from Missouri . This nonsense HAS to stop . Love it or Hate it - give it a real review or type nothing . It is obvious you have not seen the films . But for the record , I have and though this one is not nearly the best that I have seen , it is far from the worst . And even the worst I would give an actual REVOEW and would not attack the director personally . Hope this review helps some people see through the stupidity going on here .
No , there is another ! Because every Star Wars fan had to have an opinion about I , II & III and because that opinion was biased since we missed so much the atmosphere and the characters of the original trilogy , I will state the good points of `` The Return of the Jedi '' and a few corresponding bad points of the prequel . Of course , I loved the music , the special effects , the two droids , but this has been overly debated elsewhere . What we get in the original trilogy and in this particular movie : - A strong ecological concern - Anti-militarist positions - Fascinating insights about the Jedi Order and the Force - Cute creatures - Harrison Ford 's smile - A killer scene : Near the ending , when Vader looks alternatively at his son and at the Emperor . The lightning of the lethal bolts reflected on his Black helmet . And when he grabs and betrays his Master to save Luke , thereby risking his own life ! Oh , boy ! What is wrong in the prequel INMHO : - the whole `` human factor '' element that the original cast was able to push forward is somehow missing - The Force seems to be more about superpowers and somersaults , than about wisdom - Too many Jedis at once and too many Light Sabers on the screen - The lack of experience of a few actors too often threatens the coherence of the plot By the way , if you enjoy the theory of the Force as explained by Obi Web ( Obi Wen , I mean ) and Yoda , then you should read a few books about Buddhism and the forms it took in Ancient Japan . The magic of Star Wars , IMHO lies mainly in the continuing spiritual heritage from a master to his apprentice , from a father to his son , albeit the difficulties . `` De mon âme à ton âme '' , ( from my soul to yours ) , as would write Bejard to the late Zen master T. Deshimaru .
If the Australian Post Office ever needed a promotional film for recruitment then this is it.This is one of those movies who 's heart is in the right place and you can watch again and again . Miranda 's performance is touching as it shows an aspect of Australia unimagined by many Europeans , in that it can be cold , wet and bleak , just like anywhere else and just like anywhere else what is important is the people that surrounds you . The characters in the movie are warm and welcoming and make the prospect of a career move into a 'dead letter office ' a thought to be considered . Miranda has gone on to do bigger movies , but I hope she always keeps a thought inside for this one ? .
To many people , Beat Street has inspired their lifestyle to something creative concerning the hip hop culture . The young Lee is living in NY in the 80 's when hip hop was at its beginning . His a crew member of `` Beat Street '' -a b-boy crew . The movie follows Lee in his average day , dancing , graffitiing , etc . The director has succeeded in making a movie with a plot and at the same time presenting hip hop to the rest of the world . The movie has old school features such as Afrika Bambaataa & the Soul Sonic Force , Grandmaster Melle Mel & the Furious Five , the Rock Steady Crew , the New York City Breakers , and many more ... . Neither the movie Beat Street nor the Beat Street spirit will ever die .
`` Shower '' is an story about loyalty , about the unstoppable advance of modern world in the detriment of rather traditional and more human ways of life . A man forced to choose between his successful career in business , his big-city life , his wife , and his retarded young brother . The eternal doubt between what we WANT to do and what we SHOULD do . The modern China versus the ancient one . The public baths with its gatherings , its cricket fights versus the shopping centres and the skyscraper . Lots of old men and women that are no longer needed . China , one country , two systems , as Xiao Ping said ... though one of them is killing the other . Tender , moving , full of funny moments , and of bitter-sweet ones.The sensitive ones will cry and laugh equally . The actors are enormous , especially the one who performs the role of the retarded boy ; and Yang Zhang makes a good job , easy , simple , letting the story just flow by itself . My rate : 8/10
I Think It 's a great movie . because you get to see how Diana 's life at home is . she got so much aggression , and she wants to prove that girls can fight too . I think she and Adrian were great actors . Because of this movie I Am Boxing too . It really impressed me . the only negative part I think . Is the end . because It 's alright between Diana and Adrian . But you do n't get to see how it is at home . And I Did n't really like it that you also do n't get to see how her father is doing , and her brother . but i Think it was A great movie and I Think I 'm going to watch it a lot more : ) I recommend it to anyone , even when you do n't like boxing , you get to see a lot more than only boxing . I had a great time watching it .
You know , Robin Williams , God bless him , is constantly shooting himself in the foot lately with all these dumb comedies he has done this decade ( with perhaps the exception of `` Death To Smoochy '' , which bombed when it came out but is now a cult classic ) . The dramas he has made lately have been fantastic , especially `` Insomnia '' and `` One Hour Photo '' . `` The Night Listener '' , despite mediocre reviews and a quick DVD release , is among his best work , period . This is a very chilling story , even though it does n't include a serial killer or anyone that physically dangerous for that matter . The concept of the film is based on an actual case of fraud that still has yet to be officially confirmed . In high school , I read an autobiography by a child named Anthony Godby Johnson , who suffered horrific abuse and eventually contracted AIDS as a result . I was moved by the story until I read reports online that Johnson may not actually exist . When I saw this movie , the confused feelings that Robin Williams so brilliantly portrayed resurfaced in my mind . Toni Collette probably gives her best dramatic performance too as the ultimately sociopathic `` caretaker '' . Her role was a far cry from those she had in movies like `` Little Miss Sunshine '' . There were even times she looked into the camera where I thought she was staring right at me . It takes a good actress to play that sort of role , and it 's this understated ( yet well reviewed ) role that makes Toni Collette probably one of the best actresses of this generation not to have even been nominated for an Academy Award ( as of 2008 ) . It 's incredible that there is at least one woman in this world who is like this , and it 's scary too . This is a good , dark film that I highly recommend . Be prepared to be unsettled , though , because this movie leaves you with a strange feeling at the end .
Truly amazing film , the concept as a possible prophetic vision of the future is frightening . A world vastly overpopulated , unbearable heat due to the damaged ozone layer , and all our natural resources spent . In this nightmarish degenerate society we have the great Charlton Heston as a likable film noirish style detective trying to fathom the truth behind a murder , opposite the film noir legend Edward G Robinson turning in a fine last performance . One of the images that will always stay with me from this film , is the masses of people that populate the stairwells and the way in which Thorne ( Heston ) has to hop through them every time he uses them . The movie 's use of music is note worthy too , although it contains no score in the usual sense , The opening theme is good , and the subsequent snatches of music we here in Simonson 's apartment , and especially the Beethoven pieces in the euthanasia clinic are outstandingly atmospheric .
The little girl Desi is so adorable ... I cant think of a more beautiful story then this one here . It will make you cry , laugh , and believe . Knowing that this was based on a true story just made me gasp and it also made me realize that there are nice people out there . Great cast and an overall great movie .
I saw this movie with my friend and we couldnt stop laughing ! i mean there was nothing scary about this movie ! It was funny all the lines Freddy said were hilarious ! I think they shoudl n't have even made a new nightmare and just gone to Freddy Vs. jason . Although some parts were gross ( like the head blowing up ) . and any elm street film from 1- 5 sucked . this was the best besides Number 1 . I wouldnt recomend this movie if you want a good horror . But if you have nothing else to do rent this and you 'll laugh alot.I want to see the texas chainsaw massacre I think it would be scary . Freddy 's Dead The Final Nightmare overall grade : B-
The filmmaker inhaled Andy Goldsworthy 's art , his search for closeness with the land and the water , and his sense of proportion -- and so gently , so beautifully breathed it back on to film for the rest of us . `` Rivers and Tides '' loves Goldsworthy 's work and joins it as a visual concert of time and human presence in a flowing world , a world that hides its power in plain sight . See this movie !
I rented this some years ago , the video store had only VHS at the time . Straight to video was hitting it 's strides ( you know , where the box covers use the same font and color schemes of successful films ) .I did n't know what to expect other than what was printed . First thing I thought while watching was `` what the hells ' wrong with the sound ? `` -Obviously there was no dialogue dubbing . Words echoed , so I stopped munching on whatever I had to pay closer attention-mind you there 's no Shakespeare here ! , just simple talk . The story is simple enough , boy meets girl etc.. What struck me as humorous and heartfelt was , the people in the movie did n't seem like caricatures written into the story , but rather non-actors plucked temporarily from their real jobs ( uniforms included ) . All the while , you begin to sense what the filmmaker is after , then see that there are no attempts at cheap humor ( people hurting their privates , using vulgarities this could n't have hurt the marketing . There was something honest about it . I thought if they 'd have a bigger budget then it would have been better , which i 'm sure they considered daily , but , they went ahead and made it . This , I felt , was what independent film-making is all about.The word `` Indy '' , is thrown around as if it 's a Genre..Ha ! ..that 's funny !
`` Markham , '' says urbane gentleman crime-solver Philo Vance ( William Powell ) to the district attorney , `` I 'm coming more and more to the belief that Archer Coe was killed in this room . That poker , this dagger sheath , now these fragments ... it 's all here . '' `` But Vance , '' Markham says , `` do you mean to tell me a dead man walked upstairs ? '' `` I 'm not trying to tell you anything but the facts , '' Vance says . `` This is the most remarkable case in my experience . '' We 're sympathetic . Wealthy , arrogant Archer Coe , disliked it seems by all who knew him , had been found slumped in a chair in his bedroom , pistol in his hand and a gunshot wound to his head . But wait . Further examination shows Coe had been hit hard by a blunt instrument that fractured his skull . Then there 's the dagger wound in his back . Complicating matters is that Coe 's bedroom door and windows all had been locked from the inside . Coe was no suicide ; this was murder . But how could the killer have escaped ? What was the specific motivation since there are so many suspects ? And why was Coe 's brother , Brisbane Coe , found dead in the main-floor closet ? The Kennel Murder Case , now 73 years old , still provides a stylish look at the old locked- room classic whodunit . What makes it work as well as it does is , first , the mystery is complicated and clever , but still is logical . Second , is the amusing , assured performance of William Powell . Consider his work as Philo Vance as something as a rehearsal for his great performances as Nick Charles . Few things escape Vance . He uses his wits to piece things together . He 's also good company . Powell was a star in the Twenties and moved steadily upward in status and popularity when the talkies took over . His intelligence , style and effortless sophistication have made him one of the most contemporary-seeming of actors from the past . Also pleasant is seeing a few other great faces . There 's Mary Astor as Hilda Lake , the young , resentful and potentially rich ward of Coe ; Paul Cavanaugh as a titled Brit hovering around Hilda ; Helen Vinson with her notably sultry and selfish manner ( watch her really do her stuff in Vogues of 1938 ) ; Etienne Giraudot , a small elderly man as the fussy Dr. Doremus , whose job as coroner and medical examiner keeps taking him away from his meals ; and Ralph Morgan as Archer Coe 's private secretary . This movie has a high percentage of middle-aged men without an ounce of fat who can wear snug , English-cut tailored suits with ease . Most of all is Eugene Palette , with his noble belly and gravel voice , as Detective Sergeant Heath . Sergeant Heath and Vance are long-time acquaintances who actually seem to like each other .
`` I did n't want this to get complicated , Leese . I have to assume she 's gon na read that . '' Fear takes flight at 30,000 feet in this taut , action thriller . An overnight flight to Miami quickly becomes a battle for survival when Lisa ( Rachel McAdams ) realizes her seatmate ( Cillian Murphy ) is planning to use her as part of a chilling assassination plot . As the minutes tick by , she 's in a race against time to warn the potential victims before its to late . One of the many reasons I love this movie , is because of the chemistry between the two stars , McAdams and Murphy , who are also two of my top favorite actors . For example , the early scenes at the airport play more like a romantic comedy : two people keep running into each other ... . I got to hand it to the two as well , for making a film like this work . Especially , Murphy 's character.. Jackson who really seems to be sort of complicated in that way that he acts charming and innocent , yet he 's trying to do his job and make Lisa feel trapped physically and mentally . I mean , in certain parts he really seems to be concerned for Lisa . A great thrill ride all the way through . A lot of films I would hate to see a prequel or a sequel about , but actually I would n't mind a prequel to this one , which would take place with Jackson surveilling Lisa . Favorite scene is probably that headbutt scene , because it was so unexpected . There was also that nice buildup to the famous 'pen ' scene . When is she going to make her move ? There was also that nice change in McAdam 's Lisa , where she changed herself from being a victim into fighting back . I also loved the scene where she sits down in the food court and pretends to ask some ladies a survey about the food court . How great was Murphy with his whole weezing ... ..
Los Angeles TV news reporter Jennifer ( the beautiful Barbara Bach of `` The Spy Who Loved Me '' fame ) and her two assistants Karen ( the appealingly spunky Karen Lamm ) and Vicki ( the pretty Lois Young , who not only gets killed first , but also bares her yummy bod in a tasty gratuitous nude bath scene ) go to Solvang , California to cover an annual Danish festival . Since all the local hotels are booked solid , the three lovely ladies are forced to seek room and board at a swanky , but foreboding remote mansion owned by freaky Ernest Keller ( deliciously played to geeky perfection by the late , great Sydney Lassick ) and his meek sister Virginia ( a solid Lelia Goldoni ) . Unfortunately , Keller has one very nasty and lethal dark family secret residing in his dank basement : a portly , pathetic , diapered , incest-spawned man-child Mongoloid named Junior ( an alternately touching and terrifying portrayal by Stephen Furst ; Flounder in `` Animal House '' ) , who naturally gets loose and wreaks some murderous havoc . Capably directed by Danny Steinmann , with uniformly fine acting from a sturdy cast , a compellingly perverse plot , excellent make-up by Craig Reardon , a nicely creepy atmosphere , a wonderfully wild climax , a slow , but steady pace , likable well-drawn characters , and a surprisingly heart-breaking final freeze frame ( the incest subplot packs an unexpectedly strong and poignant punch ) , this unjustly overlooked early 80 's psycho sleeper is well worth checking out .
Jerome Crabbe has the lead role in this movie . I saw this movie 6 times and I still am not tired of it . This movie is similar to Flesh + Blood in some ways . Gerald Soetman is a great writer . He wrote all of Paul Verhoeven 's Dutch films . Paul Verhoeven is one of the greatest directors . I have seen all of his movies all except for Showgirls . My Mom does not like him so much but I disagree . I think all of his films are a ride to watch especially Total Recall and Basic Instinct . Jerry Goldsmith did some of his movies which include Total Recall , Basic Instinct and Hollow Man . I wish Jerry Goldsmith never died . Dutch films are different but still enjoyable .
This movie is just a lot of fun . I 've seen it a couple of times , but it always has something funny that I remember . The `` duckies and bunnies '' car scene is one of my favorites , and I still quote Morone 's versions of certain words ! There are so many running jokes , that it 's amazing . But I love Michael Keaton anyhow !
This was a well written tale of the Making of the Batman Sitcom and actually reunites our heroes on a great quest as well as offers their TV shows history . Unlike the Brady 's and Partridge family documentary movies we not only get a look into the past and present lives of Adam and Burt , but also get to see them back in action . Filled with Kapow 's and catwomen and the Riddler ( s ) , Batman is back ina well told , tale that not only gives us a satisfactory closing to the Batman series , but fills the modern fan in on all the hollywood tales that about them that have n't been heard in 35 years . Kudos ! ! !
I am a fan of animal movies . If you can take a plot and put animals as the main actors you will usually win me over . Homeward Bound did just this . They took a plot that has been as old as time and put a new spin to it . It was a complete success . It is very much an archetypal movie . You have the obi-wan of the group ( shadow ) who is wise and logical , you have the lovable but impetuous and untrusting Chance , and the prissy princess who thinks that she should be pampered and praised . These three personalities bounce off of each other very well . I also like how they made Chance and Sassy such dynamic characters , and they did not overdue it . Most people say that it can not be good because it is too much of a kids film . What they are forgetting , however , is that it is supposed to be a kids film , and this still does not take away from the acual movie . This is a good movie to watch when you are bored and you just want to watch a movie . It is a Disney movie without the cartoons , an air bud movie with a better plot . I would , without a doubt , advise you to watch it .
I 've been intrigued by this film for a while , in part because of the extremely high score here on IMDb -- a 9.0 average with over 300 votes gives it the highest rating of any accessible silent film ! How had I not heard of this film before this website ? Well , you ca n't always trust the ratings . This is actually a very good film , preserved quite well if the fine VHS transfer I rented is any indication -- excellent acting by the principals , especially William Haines as Brown , and good location work at Cambridge with some fine action footage in the climactic Harvard/Yale football game -- but the story must have seemed a hoary chestnut even in 1926 . Obnoxious , self-centered and charismatic guy goes to school and gets put in his place , becoming in the process a caring , self-sacrificing friend ; I doubt people in 1926 found much that was really exciting in the last few reels , the predictability factor is high . Still , it starts out very well , and is certainly deserving of being remembered , if not praised to the heavens . Maybe the previous 350 voters are mostly Harvard men ... EDIT Now 600+ voters and the score has actually climbed to 9.2 ! Seriously , folks , there is ballot-stuffing going on here - I defy anybody to explain why this is a better film than `` Metropolis '' or `` The General '' !
For a mature man , to admit that he shed a tear over this film is a mature response , to a mature film . If one need admit more then perhaps one could say that , `` Life '' can never be the same , after viewing such advent for it has moved us to the next level .
Excellent episode movie ala Pulp Fiction . 7 days - 7 suicides . It doesnt get more depressing than this . Movie rating : 8/10 Music rating : 10/10
I was surprised at how fascinating this movie was . The performances were extremely good , especially by Rea as the compassionate no-nonsense detective . Despite a low budget , no big FX or flashy camerawork , Citizen X somehow manages to surpass the majority of similar big Hollywood films by just . Telling . The . Story . True stories tend to end with a whimper rather than a bang , and that 's the case here , but apart from that , this is a highly recommended detective yarn .
This was the funniest piece of film/tape I have ever witnessed , bar none . I laughed myself sick the first three times I watched it . I recommend it to everyone , with the warning that if they ca n't handle the f-sharps to stay FAR away . At his best when telling stories from a kids point of view .
I saw this movie when it first came out . It was an official selection for the Temecula Valley International Film Festival and I voted for it for best picture . Justine Priestley is hot as the psychotic , but complex Amanda . This is not your ordinary psycho movie . Lots of interesting and original slants on the genre . Sort of a `` Fatal Attraction '' for the younger set with some great blues music mixed in as the object of Amanda 's affection is married to an up and coming blues singer who has less time for her husband as her career takes off .
Origins of the Care Bears & their Cousins . If you saw the original film you 'll notice a discrepancy . The Cousins are raised with the Care Bears , rather than meeting them later . However I have no problems with that , preferring to treat the films as separate interpretations . The babies are adorable and it 's fun watching them play and grow . My favourite is Swift Heart Rabbit . The villain is a delightfully menacing shapeshifter . I could empathise with the three children since I was never good at sports either . Cree Summer is excellent as Christy . The songs are sweet and memorable . If you have an open heart , love the toys or enjoyed the original , this is not to be missed . 9/10
This movie is excellent and I would recommend renting it for anyone whose local video store owns it . Or , even better , you could buy it because chances are you 're going to watch this over and over . I can remember watching this movie as a kid and it was great back then . But after watching it again yesterday I 've found it to be amazing . A good blend of comedy ( although not as great as `` Mr Magoo '' -another one of my favorites ) and action . This deserves 10/10 and I 'm hoping that they will make a sequel soon ( fingers crossed ) . If you do babysitting or have to look after young children for anything then I 'd recommend renting this movie as it will keep them entertained for hours : ) .
I just saw this film @ TIFF ( Toronto International Film Festival ) . Fans of Hal Hartley will not be disappointed ! ! And if you are not familiar with this director 's oeuvre ... does n't matter . This film can definitely stand all on its own . I have to go the second screening ... it was amazing I need to see it again -- and fast ! ! This film is very funny . It 's dialogue is very smart , and the performance of Parker Posey is outstanding as she stars in the title role of Fay Grim . Fay Grim is the latest feature revisiting the world and characters introduced in the film Henry Fool ( 2000 ) . Visually , the most salient stylistic feature employs the habitual use of the canted ( or dutch ) angle , which can be often seen in past Hartley works appearing in various shorts , available in the Possible Films : short works by Hal Hartley 1994-2004 collection , and in The Girl from Monday ( 2005 ) . I viewed this film most aptly on Sept 11th . Textually , Fay Grim 's adventure in this story is backdropped against the changed world after September 11 , 2001 . Without going into major spoilers , I view this work , and story-world as a bravely political and original portrait of geo-politics that is rarely , if ever , foregrounded in mainstream fictional cinema post-911 heretofore ( cf . Syrianna : of side note - Mark Cuban Exec . Prod in both these films ... most interesting , to say the least ) . Lastly , for those closely attached to the characters of Henry Fool , Simone , Fay and Henry this film is hilariously self-conscious and self-referential . That being said , the character of Fay Grimm starts off in the film , exactly where she was when Henry Fool ended , but by the end of the film ... Fay 's knowledge and experience has total changed and expanded over the course of the narrative . What can be in store for the future of Fay and the Fool family ... ? ? I ca n't wait for the third part in this story !
I have no idea how a Texan ( the director , Douglas McGrath ) and the American actress Gwyneth Paltrow ever pulled this off but seeing this again will remind you what all the fuss about Ms. Paltrow was in the first place ! I had long since gone off the woman and still feel she is rather dull in her Oscar-winning `` Shakespeare In Love '' performance but she gets all the beats right here -- she is nigh on perfect as Emma Woodhouse . She may have won her Oscar for Shakespeare but she should be remembered for this . Of course , she 's surrounded by a great supporting cast including Toni Collette , Greta Scacchi , Juliette Stevenson et al ... Jeremy Northam is very appealing as the love interest , even if the script wallows a bit in his declaration of love to Paltrow ( in the process , allowing all of the tension to drain out of their relationship ) ; several years on , Ewan 's hair is a little easier to take than it was in '96 and , personally , I find puckish Alan Cumming a grating presence in anything nowadays . But the standout is , without a doubt , Sophie Thompson ( sister of Emma Thompson , daughter of Phyllida Law ) as Miss Bates ; what this version needs is a scene where Emma reconciles with Miss Bates , as she is the character to whose fate we are drawn . The film is worth watching ( again even ) for her performance alone . All in all , this has aged wonderfully with charm to spare and more than enough subtlety to sort out the British class system . Well worth a rental ( because its unlikely that Paltrow will ever be this good again -- but we 'll always have Emma ) .
Trailers of this movie may show scenes of violence or non mainstream sexuality , but these scenes are just rare fragments , picked out to attract audience . They are , of course showing the main message of the movie : People who are constantly kicked on their heads in their jobs and lives , using power , which they may have somewhere else , to notoriously oppress others . And at the low end of the oppression chain , mostly women . A movie showing this as brutally as Hundstage is surely tough to face , but having to endure such lives , is even tougher . Technically the film is much like Short Cuts , but consisting of documentary style episodes , featuring people like your neighbour , playing just the way they are . Without any glitter , and most disturbingly , without any hope . Its documentary style makes the movie even more disturbing , because you realize , such people are out there , and there are many of them , although our society focuses on the nice exterior looks . Somewhere the porn industry has to do its business , somewhere unreported domestic violence has to take place , somewhere hopes have to shatter . I sure do know such people . If you want to see a movie without any funny scenes ( some may think the handicapped woman repeating the top ten supermarkets is funny , but this happens for real ) and without any melodramatic , go watch this movie . However it will lose when you are focusing on subtitles I fear , as subtitles can´t transport accentuation .
Good , funny , straightforward story , excellent Nicole Kidman ( I almost always like the movies she 's in ) . This was a good `` vehicle '' for someone adept at comedy and drama since there are elements of both . A romantic comedy wrapped around two crime stories , great closing lines . Chaplin , very good here , was also good in another good , but unpopular romantic comedy ( `` Truth about Cats & Dogs '' ) . Maybe they 're too implausible . Ebert did n't even post a review for this . The great `` screwball '' comedies obviously were totally implausible ( `` Bringing up Baby '' , etc. ) . If you 've seen one implausible comedy , you 've seen them all ? Or maybe people are ready to move on from the 1930s . Weird . Birthday Girl is a movie I 've enjoyed several times . Nicole Kidman may be the `` killer app '' for home video .
That was definitely the case with Angels in the Outfield . It was on TV last night and I believe I had n't seen the film since my sophomore year in high school and I 'm now in my 4th year of college . Although the film has many flaws , it is just so touching that you ca n't help but sit down , watch it , and enjoy yourself . It is also hilarious . Danny Glover 's ranting is just so over the top that you ca n't help but laugh out loud at him at most time . It adds to the film and I 'm sure it 's exactly what the director wanted . You actually feel for the characters in the film even though the development is n't the best . A must see . I highly recommend . 8/10
Two movies back to back which dealt with Indian POWs ; Veer Zaara and Deewaar . Although Veer Zara was a love story of a guy who gives everything up for someone , Deewaar focuses on the main subject itself . It is not hidden that many Indian POWs are rotting in Pakistani Jails for years - for whom neither Indian Govt . has time or sympathy nor the other side . I 'm sure some of Pakistani POWs are in India as well , but let 's focus on the movie . Full of actors . Some were stage actors like Raghubir Yadav , Rajendra Gupta , etc . Amitabh Bachchan who plays the role of a Major , acted well . Akshaye Khanna did his part well . There was nothing for Amrita Rao to do than a few giggles and couple songs . I think Sanjay Dutt 's role was most solid even though it was n't too long . He acted really well here and his dialog delivery was also impressive . If you compare it to LOC , which was nothing but a day long movie with story going in all directions ( if it HAD a story ) - Deewaar is a well directed movie that keeps a good pace and does justice to all actors . 7.5/10
Well , some people would say that this particular movie stinks ... but hey ! Thats not right , not right at al ... The movie may not have the best special effects , and may not have the best actors ( Except the exelence of the Barbarian Bros. ) Dispite theese minor fact , I can honostly say that this is one of the funniest movies I´ve ever seen , and I´ve seen em al !
When I sat down to watch 'Largo Winch ' I expected nothing more than action scenes and fascinating cars . When I stood up , I 've seen both of these ; and more . Karl Roden was finally not the antagonist in a movie , to start with . Kristin Scott Thomas played her role well , but the real two stars in my opinion were Tomer Sisley and Miki Manojlovic , both acting superbly . In Radivoje Bukvic portrayed Goran well . The mixed linguistics brought a nice color to the movie , but I understand why people would get bored with it . The scenery of Hong Kong and especially the stunning Croatian seaside both amazed me , and I hardly wanted to take my eyes off the screen when Largo entered the unbelievably beautiful island . Rolls Royce Phantom ; Mercedes S500 , and BMW 7 ; if anyone loves expensive limousine - type cars ; this is their movie . It is also a movie for people who love action sequences , good acting , landscapes of extremal beauty , and above all , a fast - paced , well written action movie , with dazzling combat and a thoroughly twined inner drama . My vote , as it has enlightened a gloomy day is : 10/10
I feel Monarch Cove was one of the best written and acted out `` Drama '' Series to come on any Network in a long time . This show had great potential and I could n't wait to view it each week . This could be developed into a great Primetime Soap . People look forward to this type of acting as we are being `` Reality TV '' overkilled . I long for the type of writing and acting that shows like Dallas , Knots ' Landing , Dynasty , MelRose Place , etc . provided . Monarch Cove updated this concept quite well and I anticipated it only getting better . There 's so much to expand on with these characters and they were all very interesting and captivating in their own right . It would be a loss to not explore this and develop these characters after having drawn and hooked us into their world . I absolutely loved this show because it was mysterious , interesting and sensuous without going overboard or offending . Loved It .
I simply ca n't get over how brilliant the pairing of Walter Matthau and Jack Lemmon is . It 's like the movie does n't even need additional characters because you can never get tired of the dialog between these two . Lemmon had already been in several well-known films like Mr. Roberts and The Apartment and Matthau was fresh off his Oscar win for The Fortune Cookie ( another Billy Wilder film also with Lemmon ) . That particular movie was n't as great as this one because the story could n't sustain such a long running time ( I think it was almost 2 hours ) . However , this goes by at a brisk hour and a half , even though the introduction of the events leading up to Lemmon ending up at Matthau 's apartment is a tad long ( so was this sentence ) . That 's a minor quibble though and for the rest of the running time you have a marvelous time . I have already written a comment about how the follow-up to this film sucked and I wo n't go deeper into that . The reason why this is such a joy is probably that the movie was made just as the innocence of American movies was beginning to fade fast into oblivion . There are some sexual references but they are dealt with in such an innocent way that you could n't even get a `` Well , I never ... '' out of the most prudish person out there . It is kind of fun to see a movie from a long lost era and that was probably why the sequel did n't work because you had Matthau and Lemmon say quite a few f-words and that just does n't fit them . Of course , now they are both gone and you can just be happy that you still can enjoy them in a marvelous film like this . I think the only male actor in this film who is still alive is John Fiedler . Edelman died recently . So there you have it . Simply one of the best comedies and films ever . Add : I have just learned recently that John Fiedler has died so to all the fans of him I am deeply sorry . I did n't mean any disrespect and I will try to be more careful of what I am blah blah blahing next time .
Let 's go straight to the point : this is The Movie I would take with me on a desert island ( with dvd player ) . It 's just perfect . If a reason for you to see a movie is that you love the actors , you like to see them free to involve in the space and feelings , this movie is for you . See the scene when Myrtle ( Rowlands ) come on stage drunk and Maurice ( Cassavetes ) has to improvise because she does n't follow the script anymore . If you 're sensitive to the camera 's movements , you 'll be fascinated by the way the camera moves on stage , the particular flow , that give you the impression camera follow the actors as if it was lead by the theatrical principle of `` private space '' ... amazing . And the story is just a brilliant mix of tale and realistic drama . Cassavetes is again arguing with Hollywood and the majors ' politics , but this time , he do it through Broadway , making one of the most exciting movie about theater . Well , this movie is a bliss .
As usual , Hollywood stereotyped EVERYONE in the movie . But , this one is a classic - from the uptight white collar banker to the Russian woman ! ! Well done . Even facial expressions were great ! Language was perfect ( even in Russian language ) and Nicole did a splendid job ! ! Hey guys - you get what you pay for : )
I enjoyed this film very much.Tobey Maguire gives a terrific performance as Jake . He has got to be one of the best actors I have seen . And I was surprised there were so many humorous lines throughout the film . He was extremely good at this too although I have never seen him deliver a comic line before . The film gets you involved with the characters and really makes you wonder what is to become of them all . I did not know what to expect from Jewel 's performance but I think she did rather well . Lots of exciting scenes . A thoroughly good ride . I am absolutely a fan of Maguire 's . Check out Cider House Rules . One of the all time Best Ever .
It was clear right from the beginning that 9/11 would inspire about as many films as World War II and Vietnam combined ; however , there is certainly a big danger that most of these films to come are about as good ( or rather : bad ) as Pearl Harbor . It is a great luck that the first international release about 9/11 is not a cheesy love story starring a bunch of pretty faces , but a collective work of 11 directors from the entire world . I 'm not intending to say that all 11 episodes are great ( Youssef Chahine 's , for example , has a needless prologue with too many cuts and Shohei Imamura 's has a really bizarre ending ) or that the segments are in the right order ( Imamura 's , being the only one not referring directly to the Twin Towers , should open the film , not end it , Alejandro Gonzales Inarritu 's should be the last one instead , as it 's the most impressive one ) . But it is an impressing effort and an interesting portrayal of the way other parts of the world react to the collapse of the twin towers . Consider Samira Makhmalbaf 's opening segment , in which an Afghan teachers tries to explain to her pupils what happened in New York and unsuccessfully suggests a one-minute silence . Or Idrissa Ouedraogo 's part ( which features a bin Laden-double so much resembling the real one that you 'll be shocked when you see him , I promise ) , in which 5 boys muse about good things that can be done with the reward put out on Laden . There 's a surprisingly good ( and extremely angry ) segment by Ken Loach about a man from Chile talking about what he calls `` our Tuesday September 11 '' - that September 11 in 1973 when their elected president Allende was killed and Pinochet installed his dictatorship - with the generous help from Henry Kissinger and the CIA . This could have become a terrible effort in Anti-Americanism , but it did become a sad tale and shares my recognition for the best segment with Inarritu 's ( mainly sound impressions and phone calls from the hijacked planes to a black screen , sometimes a few pictures of people falling down the WTC and finally a collapsing tower , ending with the screen brightening up and one question appearing ) and Amos Gitai 's about a hysterical reporter trying desperatly to get on air after a car bomb exploded in Tel Aviv ( hard to recognize , but this one is a masterpiece of choreography ) . All these different segments ( I have n't mentioned yet Claude Lelouch 's about a deaf girl , Danis Tanovic 's about a demonstration of the Women of Srebrenica , Mira Nair 's - strange , but it takes an Indian director to make the part that is probably most appealing to Western tastes - about a Muslim family whose son is under a terrible suspicion after 9/11 and Sean Penn 's with Ernest Borgnine ( yes , Ernest Borgnine ) as a widower leading the most depressive life one can imagine ) add up to a unique film not easy to watch and hard to forget . I am sure this film will be a classic known to everyone thirty years from now . I hope it will be remembered for starting a long tradition of world cinema movies . But , alas , it 's far more probable it will be remembered as a one-film-only effort . And as the one of the few 9/11 movies made by then that do n't reduce this terrible event to a love story with a happy end just to please the audience .
The kids , aged 7 to 14 , got such a huge kick out of this film that we gave a copy to all of the other kids on our birthday list this year . They all loved it ! Kids from 2 to 7 watch it repeatedly and frequently , and we get a kick out of watching it with them . It 's rare that a film entertains the kids for so long , and offers laughs for the adults , too . Most enjoy it more than the first . Top-quality production and an excellent cast , led by Christopher Showerman as a superior George -- athletic , energetic , and wholly credible , with a lovable innocence and a particular knack of taking a tree in the face -- well supported by the inimitable Christina Pickles as the evil mother-in-law , Thomas Haden Church as the evil jerk rival , and everybody else . This is fun .
Just saw the World Preem of Fido at the Toronto International Film Festival and thoroughly enjoyed it . Here we have a welcome reworking of a genre widely thought to have been pioneered ( certainly 'fleshed out ' extensively and successfully ) by George Romero . But this is a Canadian film by a Canadian Director and it 's a Comedy ! And , YES , I actually think it is better than 'Shawn of the Dead ' . Thoroughly believable and , perhaps even more importantly , enjoyable performances by Dylan Baker , Carrie-Anne Moss and young actor K'Sun Ray , whom I suspect we 'll be seeing a lot more of in future features . However , I must confess that I most enjoyed the delicious turn by Tim Blake Nelson as neighbour Mr. Theopolis , essentially playing a willing animated version of Victor Van Dort from the Corpse Bride ( or , for those who 've seen the film , would n't that read even better here as the Corpse Pride ? ) and , of course , Scotch actor Billy Connolly in his least animated , yet somehow deeply moving role as the titular character . Just think , he would not have gotten this role had it not been for Peter Stormare 's commitments to Prison Break ( as was revealed in the Q & A following Thursday night 's screening ) . I ca n't help but speculate that the Screenwriters must have drawn a lot of inspiration from Day Of The Dead 's Zombie 'Bub'.I am not keen on ever revealing plot details during a Comment and I wo n't start now . Suffice it to say that Fido is NOT one of those dour , graphically gory Zombie films you can rely on from Romero . Rather it is a film that will have you constantly chuckling and , although ( and I did have to think back carefully to be sure ) there is a fair dose of blood-letting and violence , the delectable humour , so well enhanced by the surreal milieu created by Director Currie and his co-screenwriters , goes a long way towards making this seem like a feature that ought to be rated PG-13 . I urge you to go see this little Canuck gem . I 'll certainly be buying the DVD once it emerges hopefully by next Summer .
I may be getting ahead of myself here , but although the film itself was a technical masterpiece for its time , I watched it piece-by-piece on TCM last night , the question arises to me : Why did they do that ? putting their lives in jeopardy , many of them died on the trek , why would they undertake such a life-endangering journey , just to find food for their animals ( ! ) once they reached the `` land of milk and honey '' , why did n't they just stay there ? Would you endanger your life , and that of your entire community , just to find food for a herd of cattle ? As dangerous as it was , to do it for that purpose alone , shows the inbred simplicity of these types of people . Risk death for a cow ? ? Better them than I !
This movie should be required viewing for all librarians or would-be librarians . All of the best lines are directly related to librarianship . The public library vs. academic library argument is a classic argument waged among librarians and library school students . It also breaks many librarian stereotypes . Librarians might even be capable of having fun -- even if they do n't *usually* have sex in the romance languages section ! ( The best movie about librarians ? Desk Set , with Katherine Hepburn and Spencer Tracy , of course . )
This is one of the best movie I have ever seen . My parents comes from rural India and to some extend I have seen the life of the villagers . Peoples are really poor and have financial and social problems . The movie just reflects exactly the same . Full credit to the director and the actor . They have done an excellent job . I just wonder how can movies like Lagaan and Paheli can go for Oscar and not Doghi . I do n't understand the criteria on which the movies are selected . Is the money that makes the difference or having some big names in the movie makes the difference . Hope to see more movies like this in the future .
It took a long time until I could find the title in a special videothek in Berlin , and I was lucky to find an english version with hollandish undertitles . I think it´s one of the best horrormovies ever . It seems strange for me that some people call this movie a black comedy . I must admit , I wasn´t able to laugh about , when I saw it the first time ( and it was the same with the second time ! ) On the one hand Trelkovski seems so nice and even cute in his shy behaviour , but on the other hand he beats this boy on the playground and there is no explanation for that . But the most weired thing is of course his transformation in Simone Choule and the fact , that he doesn´t know , who he really is . His halluzinations are the most terrifying in this movie . Of course it´s all in his mind , but is it this flat that brings out this female side of him or was it also before he moved in - I think that´s an interesting question . His shizophrenic behaviour is hard to understand and it´s horrible to see his two sides or identities fighting against each other . The result of it is that he cuts his hand first and later jumps out of his/her window . But this terrible cry - does that mean , that all will repeat again and again and again ... that his soul is in a cage or something ? And these egyptian hieroglyphs and other egyptian stuff ? The fact , that he/she looks like a mummy in the Hospital - that´s not an incident , but a clue in my point of view .
Got ta start with Ed Furlong on this one . You got ta . God bless this kid . $ 5 bucks says the character he plays in this film is what he 's really like in real life . He has a one-liner or two that made me almost blow snot because of the subtle humor in the script . You know all the trials this guy has gone through in recent years and it does n't even seem like Furlong is even acting . Maybe that 's why his performance was good . Same with Madsen . You keep thinking , `` I bet this guy is really like this in real life . '' Does Madsen even have to act ? Just natural . Vosloo has obviously moved on from the type-casted Mummy guy . I think the biggest surprise to this film was Jordana Spiro 's performance . Her reactions are spot-on in this film . I battled if she was hot or not , but realized I would just like to see more of her . Not a big fan of shoot 'em out/hostage type films . But what I am a fan of are films with lots of twists and turns to try and keep you guessing . It 's not just your standard robbers take over a bank , they kill hostages , and the good guys win in the end type of film . The twists keep on coming ... and coming . The café scenes work best with the hand-held cams to show what it 's really like in there . Not glossed over a bit . Think like Bourne Ultimatum `` lite '' style on some scenes in the café . And for those Bo Bice fanatics out there - actor Curtis Wayne ( who plays Karl ) will make you do a double take . These guys are twins . As I watched I wondered why some of the actors had foreign accents and what were they doing in this small town . Made sense in the end that these people smuggled stuff to other countries/states so they might have these accents . But more is revealed in the bonus features of how some of the producers wanted to make this film for International audiences with some of their stars we might not have heard of . And some of them are smoking hot . Moncia Dean ? Need I say more .
Superbly developed characters into the lots of funny situations full of spirit , absurdness and Serbian mentality . Movie is a great comedy , enjoyable , interesting , unpredictable . Best point in a film : characters , then humor itself , story and dialogs . Humor has 'inner development ' , rare in Serbian movies . So , it is consequence of characterization , is well motivated , spontaneous and cogent . Also it is sharp , intelligent and lucid . Most of the movies , unfortunately , had constructed humor ( devise a joke and put it into a characters 's mouth ) or ordinary situation comedy , burlesque , farce . Some of the 'art immortality ' are incorporated in this movie . Little masterpiece , hardly reachable .
I saw this film with a special screening of the work of Owen Alik Shahadah . It is so interesting where did this guy come from . Now he is probably the key independent African filmmaker in the world . And I am not talking about black filmmakers I am talking about filmmakers who are rooted in culture . The idea if anything testifies to the diversity and range of African themes , with his film 500 Years Later it is a African issue . But the Idea does n't fit that mold . Showing the artistic diversity . The film is an all African cast but the topic is a human topic which most of us could relate to . I just love the mild comedy in it . And the Kora of Tunde Jegede is just amazing , it is really a art-house gem .
It takes guts to make a movie on Gandhi in India , in which he is not shown as a man who could do no wrong.This movie shows how a Mahatma failed to be a decent father ( at least in the eyes of his son ) . The performances are terrific , the cinematography fantastic , the direction fabulous , but the film drags.If the intention was to make this movie without any box-office expectations , which i assume is the case here , then its a brilliant attempt , but if the makers were expecting this to be a commercial success , then the film 's fate was doomed the day they chose this subject.. 20 yrs from now , this movie will be remembered for the brilliant portrayal of Harilal by Akshaye Khanna.He deserves an Oscar nomination for this one..And honestly , his is not the only performance worth applauding , Shefali Chhaya is terrific too.. Watch the scene where Harilal hears about his father 's death.No dialogues , No screaming , but a speechless shot by Khanna.Its one of the finest scenes ever shot in the history of Cinema Gandhi , My Father is not at all exciting cinema but yes , its excellent cinema and a must watch.Brilliant Attempt..
I 've seen the Thin Man series -- Powell and Loy are definitely great , but there is something awfully sweet about Powell and Arthur 's chemistry in this flick . Jean Arthur SHINES when she looks at Powell . There is an unmistakable undercurrent buzzing between them . This film may not have the wit of the Thin Man series , but undeniably makes up for it in charm . While I watched it , I thought for sure Powell was carrying on an off-screen affair with Arthur . My friends thought the same . This is one film where I wish I could step back in time ( to schmooze and lock lips with Powell ! ) There seems to be no end to his lovable playful smirks ! Powell 's character , Lawrence Bradford , is probably the closest thing to the `` perfect man . '' Okay , this is sounding way too gushy , but I ca n't help myself .
What a gem of a movie , so good that they made a sequel . The film starts off really good with a nasty monster who eats a few people and a party where the 2 main characters first set eyes on each other . Bendan Hughes plays the eccentric Vlad , a bit of an inkling there to who this character is , who has moved into town and uses the services of a particular real estate agent to find him a house . Hell , we 've all seen vampire movies , we know the format . The movie is watchable , but the actors ' performances are very wooden and they seem as they do n't want to be in this film , but may be that 's just all part of the decadent ambiance . Did n't like the ending , but there is a sequel , must track it down . When I watched the film I thought Brendan Hughes did n't really fit the part . Later on , I could n't stop thinking about him , he sort of exudes an eerie sensuality , so maybe he was right for the part . BRENDAN HUGHES Last seen in 'Hitler - the rise of evil ' as Lt. Guffman . Where is he now ?
It was a serious attempt to show the developing sexuality of two schoolgirls and did not try to exploit its fact Even by today 's standards , the film is interesting and provocative Therese and Isabelle are both attending the same girl 's school Therese is energetic , intelligent , and becomes a mentor for the innocent , naive , sweet Isabelle She guides her through a number of exotic experiences , including a trip through an exclusive brothel , into her first lesbian liaison , and indirectly into her first heterosexual experience The film does not exploit any sex , nor is there an abundance of nudity ... The imagery is effective , but sometimes the camera lingers too long , and the story goes slowly The director , Radley Metzger , went on to make a number of explicit erotic films under the name of Henry Paris He always has extremely detailed stories , good acting , and very high standards of cinematography ... Artistically , however , this is perhaps his most complete His later attempts supplied for entertainment , whereas `` Therese and Isabelle '' was a study into the nature of youthful eroticism ...
I enjoyed this film . It was funny , cute , silly , and entertaining . Had a fine cast and really got hammered by some critics for reasons that I truly do n't understand . No , it was n't `` The Grapes of Wrath '' or `` Casablanca '' or even `` Moonstruck '' , but it was an enjoyable film . Julia was excellent playing the psychotic 'man behind the man ' . The story is a little silly to be sure , but it this is n't high drama , folks . I happened to see a review of the film , probably the only good one it got and then ran into it one night when looking for a movie . I never heard it was supposed to stink until after I saw it , and I 'm glad I saw it . Eventually bought the VHS tape on the bargain pile , and I watch it a couple times a year .
I like this movie because it is a fine work of cinema , made by people who care enough to make it art and not just home movies . It is filled with Super-surfer Greg Noll 's home movies , and a boatload of amateur video from others who align themselves with his 50-year passion . Nevertheless , it has been expanded to the degree that it approaches aesthetic glory . It is filled with artistic talent , and athletic talent , however trivial you might think surfing to be athletic . Surfers are not astronauts nor test-pilots . Nor are they surgeons ( perhaps ) or Ph.d 's ( again , perhaps ) . It believes in the quest of the surfer . It believes in the beauty of human goofiness . It believes in the great gift of peace , which comes from the cessation of war . Surfers celebrate the cessation of war on the north beach of an Hawaiian island attacked by Japanese zeroes fifteen years before . It celebrates the down-time of a country which fought a cold war-instead of a hot-war - with the Russian socialists . Surfing is the ultimate narcissism . It is dangerous , but only slightly historical . I suspect Alexander the Great would not be celebrated for his surfing technique . He had to go out and conquer a few dozen countries to get the favorable press he has received . This movie has no military heroes . It has no guns . The only beach-head surfers conquer has a beer-stand and and a surfboard shop . This is not a problem . Peace is not desperate . It is the joy of exhalation .
In my opinion , this is an absolutely romantic Disney masterpiece . If you ask me , the stepmother ( voice of Lucille La Verne ) was truly diabolical . You 'll have to see the movie if you want to know why . On the other hand , despite the fact that she did a lot of housekeeping , Cinderella ( voice of Ilene Stanley ) was a very beautiful lady . To me , the scenery was beautiful , the cast was well chosen , and the writing was strong . Before I wrap this up , I 'd like to say that everyone involved in this film did very well . Now , in conclusion , I highly recommend this absolutely romantic Disney masterpiece to all of you who have n't seen it . You 're in for a good time , so go to the video store , rent it or buy it , kick back with a friend , and watch it .
Marlene Dietrich and Charles Boyer give solid performances in this beautiful but empty film . The irony is that Dietrich plays a woman with a beautiful but empty life . Truly gorgeous cinematography and sets , and yes Dietrich 's bottomless trunk of clothes are also fabulous . She look great ; Boyer looks young and trim . Story of a woman seeking meaning and an ex-priest seeking life seems pretty stale , but set against such unreal sets and skies it somehow works , given the two stars , the terrific score by Max Steiner , and a good supporting cast . The film runs like 76 minutes and seems badly edited , plus certain characters just appear or disappear . Joseph Schildkraut is funny as the Arab guide , C. Aubrey Smith is the old priest , Lucile Watson the mother superior , Tilly Losch the dancer , John Carradine the diviner , and Basil Rathbone plays ... . well I 'm not sure . He just rides in from the desert and spoils everything ! As others have noted , John Gilbert was slated to star with Dietrich . I ca n't help but think he would have been wonderful . The role of world-weary Boris would have suited the great Gilbert quite well . And after the success of Queen Christina ( with Garbo ) , his career might have gotten back on track . I ca n't think of any other 30s film Dietrich did in color . She looks great and wears some terrific clothes . My favorite is the Valentino as The Shiek-like outfit she wears by the pool . Certainly worth a look for the lush sets and color and the two great stars .
Atlantis was much better than I had anticipated . In some ways it had a better story than come of the other films aimed at a higher age . Although this film did demand a solid attention span at times . It was a great film for all ages . I noticed some of the younger audience expected a comedy but got an adventure . I think everyone is tired of an endless parade of extreme parodies . A lot of these kids have seen nothing but parodies . After a short time everyone seemed very intensely watching Atlantis .
i found it highly intellectual and artistic in every way ! i felt that the script was conveying all the things i feel physically and emotionally when i got home from work and watched , it . this is a tribute to cinema in the highest form and format . holy guacamole ! how i wish those days would come again . i tried putting a bubble window on the side of my car ( honda civic 1984 ) , but the vacuum formed muffin trays did n't quite cut it . also in my civic , sexual positions are limited and are not supported by water bed as is brilliantly depicted in 'the van ' . 'the van ' is of the utmost side splitting hilarity and can even substitute for porn if you watch some scenes privately . i highly anticipate that Sam Grossman ( the director ) has achieved his opus . Ratings john : ****1/2 Sam : *****
This is a nice piece of work . Very sexy and engaging enough plot to keep my interest throughout . Its main disadvantage is that it seems like it was made-for-TV : Full screen , and though there were several sex scenes , there was absolutely no nudity ( but boy did it come close ! ) . Strange , too , since Netflix shows that it was rated R. Nonetheless , very titillating , and I wish Alicia Silverstone made more movies like this . One Netflix reviewer stated that it was part of a series , but I have been unable to find out what series that is . I 'd like to find out , though , because this movie was THAT good .

Michael Curtiz directed this 1930 very-stylish whodunit from a script by Robert Presnell Sr. , Robert N. Lee and Peter Mine . The original novel they adapted was `` The Kennel Murder Case '' , perhaps from a writer 's standpoint the best of the Philo Vance mysteries by the strange S.S. Van Dine . Vance was a long-worded and superior detective genius , and his character being assigned to William Powell probably meant the executives at Warner Brothers were aware of the possibility that in less-engaging hands this detective might alienate viewers . Fortunately they assigned suave William Powell first to the character . ; later he was played by Basil Rathbone , Warren William , and Paul Lukas before being consigned to `` B '' picture status.The other question as always with Warner Brothers executives is why they chose Vance as a character ; their penchant was to choose men who operated outside the law , with no apparent discrimination between a vicious murderer and a champion of individual rights against all comers . This film has a despicable villain who gets murdered , and a claustrophobically challenging locale inside an apartment complex . The characters are unarguably unusually well-realized , the direction rather good and unusually swift-paced ; and except for a darkish B/W look , the film avoids the comedic asides , superfluous characters and irrelevant dialogue characteristic of many early detective entries . Jack Okey did the good art direction . The music by Berhard Kaun is serviceable ; Orry-Kelly did the costumes . William Reese provided the mostly-indoor cinematography . In the interesting cast , Powell is THE Philo Vance of his time , mostly sober-minded with just a hint of sardonic humor here and there . Eugene Palette is better than usual playing very straight as an admiring police partner to Vance , with his very professional timing . The other actor who comes off best is handsome Paul Cavangh , very effective as always in what was written as a red herring part . Mary Astor is attractive but at this point in her career she talked a bit too fast to be as effective as she later proved . Also in the cast were Helen Vinson as the villain 's woman , Jack La Rue , Ralph Morgan ( best known as Frank Morgan 's brother ) , Robert Barrat as the villain everyone has cause to kill , Archer Coe , and Frank Conroy as his likable brother with Robert McWade as the D.A . ; quirky and funny Etiienne Girardot has a delightfully witty part as the funny little forensics doctor who comes onto the crime scene . James lee as the abused Chinese servant is excellent and intelligent . The story breaks into four parts . First there is shad doings at a dog show , where Vance , Coe and Cavanagh are all showing West Highland terriers . Cavanagh 's dog is killed , by Coe , to prevent him winning the title over his own entry . The second portion of the scene involves a leave-taking ; someone is confused enough by who has gone where , after Coe parts from his girl friend , Vinson , to murder his nice brother by mistake . Enter Vance , to find out who did in Archer Coe in a locked room and how , with the help of Palette ; the romantic difficulties are straightened out , the Chinese servant is exonerated , we find out who broke the expensive vase , who will marry whom , how Archer Coe was done in and why the butler did not do it -- but someone else with a good excuse did . This is a more-than-good little mystery , which skilled Hungarian-born director Curtiz took quite seriously . He used wipes , swift cuts , changes of camera angle and alternations between straightforward and daring camera-work to achieve variety , interest and a sustained pace . Many writers , critics and experts , myself included , consider this to be the best of the Vance projects , although others are estimable as well .
I started watching The Apprentice about 4 years ago ( maybe 5 ) and I really really liked it . The first thing that strikes you about it is the refreshing format , which though similar to a lot of other reality shows at its core , is still very entertaining . Donald Trump is wonderful as the host and the main judge of the show as well . The casting coup with intelligent people having good looks being picked as contestants is appreciated as well . But the best part of the show is New York city . Mark Burnett may have made a lot of crap in his time but his handling of the cinematography is excellent as he makes NYC look like a character unto itself . The jazz tunes coupled with some great camera-work make New York look spectacular . The Apprentice will easily alway make my top 3 reality shows of all time ( The Amazing Race is no . 1 , however ) .But just like the amazing race this show is always best watched in moderation . If you keep watching it for a while the originality of the show will wear off fast ( the same case as with TAR ) .Star World , the broadcasters in this country , did a bang up job in presenting the show . The first three seasons were shown in a row , then after 2 years the next two seasons were shown , which kept the concept fresh . In conclusion , you will love this show , especially the first 2 seasons . However if you keep watching the show continuously , thereafter its charm WILL wear off and FAST .
I would imagine that if Steve McQueen knew he would go on to become an icon and start `` Wanted : Dead of Alive '' the same year this film came out , or be in The Magnificent Seven two years later , he would not have done it . But he did , and we are the richer for it . Sure it 's a camp classic . Horror the way it was meant to be for the drive-in theater . It 's fun and nostalgic . It is interesting that the last lines of the film were : Lieutenant Dave : At least we 've got it stopped . Steve Andrews : Yeah , as long as the Arctic stays cold . They never would have imagined 52 years ago that the Arctic would be thawing . The Blob will soon return .
Best-selling horror novelist Cheryl ( a solid and sympathetic performance by the lovely Virginia Bryant ) , her husband Tom ( the likable Paolo Serra ) , and their son Bobby ( nicely played by Patrizio Vinci ) go to a remote castle located in the countryside for summer vacation . Local legend claims that the area is cursed . Cheryl discovers a creepy , hairy , nasty ogre ( hulking David Flosi in a strikingly hideous costume ) living in the basement . Cheryl has to surmount her deep-seated childhood fear of the beast so she can defeat the foul find . Director/co-writer Lamberto Bava does an expert job of creating and sustaining an eerie and unnerving nightmarish mood . Moreover , Bava eschews the standard blood'n'guts fright flick routine in favor of crafting a compelling and provocative dark adult fairytale-like fable on how the best way to overcome that which frightens us is to face said source head on . Sturdy supporting turns by Sabrina Ferilli as friendly school teacher Anna , Stefania Montorsi as hottie babysitter Maria , and Alex Serra as batty painter Dario . Gianfranco Transunto 's glossy cinematography boasts a few fluid tracking shots and plenty of great atmospheric lighting . Fabrizio Sforza 's gnarly make-up f/x , Simon Boswell 's splendidly spirited spooky'n'shuddery score , and the dank , dark , cobweb-covered cellar set all hit the skin-crawling spot . Well worth watching .
On September 11th , 2001 , millions were killed ; but 2,819 lives ended in an especially gruesome manner . They were the victim of a plane hijacking by extremists whose sole mission was to destroy buildings , but more importantly , people . This film takes an in-depth look at four people whose lives were cut short by this disastrous event and one man whose life was shattered by the loss of their lives . Charlie Fineman ( played by Adam Sandler ) , a former dentist living in New York , loses his wife and three children on September 11th as they were on their way to Los Angeles . Emotionally annihilated by the events , he eventually loses touch with everyone who reminds him of his former life ; including his in-laws and his best friend ( played , respectively , by Robert Klein , Melinda Dillon , and Mike Bender ) . He goes into completely denial and does his best to forget about his former life . This continues until he runs into his old college friend Alan Johnson ( played by Don Cheadle ) who Fineman does n't seem to remember . The two begin to catch up , but Fineman believes Johnson was sent by people from his former life to persuade him into finding help . Slowly , but surely , Fineman regains his trust for Johnson . While all this is happening , Alan Johnson 's life is going down the wrong path . He is a self man ( dentist ) who helps start a dental practice . One day , a patient of his named Donna Remar ( played by Saffron Burrows ) attempts to make a move on him , telling him that she would like to perform oral sex for him . This is an unwelcome surprise to Dr. Johnson since he is a married man with two children . As he is coming home from work on a particular workday , he sees his old friend ( Fineman ) and tries to flag him down . He is unsuccessful , but he gets another opportunity and persuades Fineman to get a come of coffee with him to catch up , despite the fact that Fineman does n't know who he is . One of the most interesting things about this movie is its use of music as a motif . One of Fineman 's physiological crutches is music , particularly Springsteen and other classic rock artists . When Fineman is asked to open up about his past or to talk about things he finds unpleasant , he puts on his earphones and drowns out the world with things his music . When the film was over , I had me thinking : how would I cope with the loss of my family ? How would I deal with such a tragic events . It 's something we do n't really think about too often . We always think they 'll be there and we often take them for granted , whether we intend to or not . We usually realize how important they are when it 's too late ; and a blow like that can destroy someone physically , emotionally , and physiologically . I really do n't know how I would be able to deal with something like that . Would I face the problem head on , cope , and move on with my life or would I just put my headphones on and block the world ?
This is one of the greatest child-pet movies ever created . I cry every time I see Shadow yelling `` Wait , wait for me Peter ! '' as the family car is pulling away . This is a must see if you love animals ! Best Movie Ever ! The lines in the movie are sometimes stupid . Like when Sassy says to Chance ; `` Cat 's Rule and dogs drool ! '' Lines like this I could do without , but when I was six I bet I loved that line . The storyline may seem hooky to some , but I like it . Shadow as the older dog who 's preparing Chance to take over for him when he 's gone is really moving when you think about it . It reminded me of my childhood dog . I think everyone can find a piece of themselves in `` Homeward Bound . ''
An adult , realistic , cruel , dark story , like a second part of `` les roseaux savages '' ( the wild reeds ) , plenty of beauty and sadness , ellipsis and silences , shadows and little sparks of hope . a man searching for a warm companion , a better life , a sincere attitude .
Put yourself into Carla 's shoes . She is an overworked , unappreciated administrative drudge who is invisible . You know her : she 's trained three of her last three bosses , knows where all of the bodies are buried and might even look back at you in the mirror when you brush your teeth . Always having time for another thankless task and does it better than most despite a serious disability , she has the desk on the way to the restroom that becomes the repository of half-finished cups of coffee begging to be spilled . What ? You do n't want to hear it ? Well , she ca n't and neither can you until your hearing aid is in place . Prepare to experience life from the perspective of the hearing impaired . Carla ( Emmanuelle Devos ) needs a change in her life . Work is leading nowhere ; friends are relying on her to meet their domestic needs and the only way out starts with a collapse that goes virtually unnoticed . She wo n't take a vacation - a contract is going critical - so the only alternative is to hire an assistant . Carla submits requirements that convey her real needs : a 'well-groomed ' man . This brings an applicant for approval that reminds us that we should be careful with our wishes . Paul ( Vincent Cassell ) does everything wrong from the start of his job interview and his getting hired clearly demonstrates Carla 's interest in his non-job-related qualities . She sees potential in this former thief and as the story unfolds , their relationship grows in a very unusual pattern of co-dependence . Paul has a difficult transition returning to the world outside of prison walls and finds himself in another sort of prison : one of the office variety and another of indentured servitude to pay off an old debt . His skills as a thief help Carla win a political battle in the office . But Paul sees a grander opportunity with Carla 's skill in lip reading and draws her even further into a world of intrigue . This is a brutal film noir unrated and probably suitable for older teens . Carla grows more powerful , professionally as well as personally , as the story progresses and her disability gives her clear advantages over the rest of us . She grows as a woman discovering her sensual side while she uses her resources to overcome the obstacles of competing in a man 's world . The two main characters are meant for each other , in a strange way . Without Paul , Carla will remain in her role of a doormat . She has our sympathy , hopes and best wishes even if she does n't make the best decisions along the way . You will hear the world through Carla 's ears , from awkward adjustments of your hearing aid , muffled sounds , all but inaudible without it to relatively distinct voices when you can see who 's talking . With one major sense disabled , we see Carla 's heightened intuitive power to compensate . And we can all use that sense to hear not only what people say , but also what they really mean .
I have seen Slaughter High several times over the years , and always found it was an enjoyable slasher flick with an odd sense of humor , but I never knew that it was filmed in the UK , and I never knew that the actor that plays Marty Rantzen ( Simon Scuddamore ) committed suicide after the film was released . I guess I did notice while watching it last night that the actors phrasing seems rather odd for Americans , and a few of them are n't very good at hiding their English accents . All that aside though , this is the tale of the class nerd , Marty , who is the butt of jokes from his classmates , and on one particular day , April Fools Day , he 's lured into the girl 's locker room by one Caroline Munro ( yes , playing a teenager ) and humiliated big time on film . Of course , the coach catches the gang at work & they 're all given a vigorous workout to punish them , but not before a couple of the guys slip Marty a joint , which he tries to smoke in the chemistry lab , but it 's full of something that makes him sick & when he runs to the restroom , one of his classmates slips in and puts a chemical that reacts with something Marty is mixing , which results in a fire and the spill of a bottle of nitric acid , which leaves poor Marty burned & horribly scarred . Ten years later , this same gang is headed for their class reunion at good old Doddsville High , which seems oddly boarded up and inaccessible , but thanks to ingenuity they manage to get in and find the place seemingly derelict ... except there 's a room where a banquet and liquor is laid out and so of course , they eat , drink , and be merry . For soon , they will die , of course . The gang is stalked one-by-one by a figure in a jester 's mask , but could it be Marty ? They do n't know , they figure he 's either in a loony bin or working for IBM , they 're not sure which . But whoever it is , he 's making quick work of them . Particularly nasty is the girl that takes a bath to wash blood off her from one of her classmates whose innards popped all over her when he drank poisoned beer . She is victim to an acid bath which I believe may have been one of the parts originally cut in the tape version , because it seemed extra nasty when I watched it this time . I could be wrong but I believe that was n't on the tape . At any rate , there 's somewhat of a twist ending , and that also contains footage not on the tape , I believe . There 's also a bit of frontal nudity early on that was also excised , but apart from that I did n't really notice if there were other bits on this uncut version , probably so but it 's been a while since I 've last seen it . At any rate , if you 're a fan of 80 's slasher flicks then snap up the new release DVD , because it 's a fun little slasher with a good atmosphere & feel to it . 7 out of 10 .
This is one of the greatest films I have ever seen : I glowed inside throughout the whole film . The music and cinematography held the spell when little was happening on screen . The slow pace was set by the mode of travel ( a riding lawn mower with a big trailer ) and was maintained by the background sights and sounds and the slow-paced lives of the other characters . The story actually happened ; Alvin Straight died in 1996 at the age of 76 . There was no acting ; everything was completely real , as if the actors had actually transformed into the characters . Sissy Spacek gave a poignant performance as a somewhat disabled daughter who had suffered much but forged ahead , always wanting to do the right thing . Richard Farnsworth was cast perfectly and he beautifully became Alvin Straight , a stubborn but loving elderly man who treks across Iowa to visit his estranged brother , Lyle , who has had a stroke . Alvin had learned much wisdom during his life and that seemed to bring out the best in the people that he encountered along the way . The film underscores the importance of family to this man and , hopefully , to all of us . I eagerly anticipate seeing it again , and again . Directed by David Lynch , this films proves his directorial skill . Farnsworth was nominated for an Academy Award for Best Actor ; at 79 , he was the oldest nominee ever for that award .
Ko to tamo peva is the best comedy of all times . Believe me i saw a lot of movies and comedies but tell me which one make you smile every time you watching it . But truth is that the humour in this comedy is special.It is caratherisic for serbia . And all former republic of yugoslavia know it very well ! ! ! So i think the rest of audience ( for example : In Europe ) ca n't enjoy it so much . Because the subtitles ruin the hole thing . But they should at least try ! ! ! ! Yes it is ironic ! This is the best flick in Serbian history and the world does n't understand it ! : - ) If you have got a chance to see this one , do n't blew up OK !
This film has a powerful philosophical ending . But that ending has meaning only if you watch the movie from the beginning . Youth alienation in the late 1960 's , from the viewpoint of a young man and a young woman , is the obvious theme of `` Zabriskie Point '' . Neither Mark Frechette nor Daria Halprin had much acting experience , a fact that actually enhances the film 's message . Having untrained actors conveys a sense of realism , as both players seem emotionally detached from the turmoil around them . This is not a script-driven film . Except for the first ten minutes , it is mostly visual , with stunning cinematography . The beautiful naturalistic images seem other-worldly , and perfectly in sync with the emotional detachment of Mark and Daria . I would have replaced the thematically weak Pink Floyd music with the more cogent music of The Doors . Many scenes cry out for `` Riders On The Storm '' . Even so , I like this film . It 's different ; it 's unique ; it is artistic and imaginative . And the desert badlands are beautiful . As the years go by , `` Zabriskie Point '' seems more and more attractive . It conveys the mood of the late 1960 's in America . It is amazingly artistic , in a bohemian sort of way . And the film 's last eight minutes are philosophically mesmerizing .
This is one of the most guilty pleasure movies ever ! I am embarrassed to say that my favorite character is TISH , but still enjoy watching her make her space outfit `` like super cool '' with a `` like totally bitchin '' belt and stick on rhinestones on her face . But anyways , the movie is actually one of the few `` family '' movies that holds your interest . I know that the begining drags , particuarly if you know what is going to happen , but the second half is probably one of the most nerve wracking segments in a family film . I would n't stand up in front of millions of people and proclaim to love this movie , in fact renting it is pretty embarrassing itself , but I 'll admit it here with the internet to hide behind .
Ying , a Chinese girl who speaks Czech , invited us to screening of a Czech movie ( with English subtitles ) in the Department of Visual and Environmental Studies ( VES ) . It was the first time I saw Samotá & # 345 ; i ( Loners , 2000 ) and it was pretty good . Much like in many other Czech movies , the seven central characters seem to have a pretty difficult , dirty life ; the web indicates that this theme was popular among the U.S. movies in the early 1990s . Their relationships are breaking up , combining , and recombining . Another typical feature of the Czech movies is that neither of the characters is designed to be a universally negative one and neither of them is a permanently positive character either . Also , you can see how the characters judge the features of others depending on the context ; that 's a very realistic feature of the movie 's psychological analysis . Ond & # 345 ; ej is a talented and married young surgeon who has two daughters . Nevertheless , you learn that he has only studied neurobiology to prove how much he loved another woman , Hanka . He is so obsessed that he repeatedly dresses up as a plumber to get into Hanka 's parents ' house - a house that he repeatedly burns . Meanwhile , Hanka has a very mixed relationship with her parents . She just decides - by tossing up a coin - to break up with Petr who works in a private radio station . Hanka does not view her parents ' bourgeois life as a good example but seems rather unsuccessful in creating a better environment . But she is a very flexible figure , as far as the type of her boyfriends go . For a while , Hanka seems to have serious plans with Jakub , an innocent drug addict whose memory seems to be rather devastated by the drugs . However , the friends from his band inform Jakub that he already has another girlfriend . Hanka is disappointed and returns to her parents . When Hanka and Petr break up , it is organized by Robert , a matchmaker who also works for a travel agency where his job is to show the life of ordinary Czech people to Japanese tourists . Robert - who also provides Jakub with marijuana - is never serious about anything and he usually sleeps with many different women ; eventually , his mother dies in a hospital and he has his own ways to deal with the depression . Vesna ( a Slavic word for `` Spring '' ) who came to Prague from Macedonia works as a barmaid - and you wo n't learn whether she came to Czechia in order to see her dad or UFOs . She seems pretty confused but sometimes helps the other characters from their problems . Petr works in the radio station and he is the only one who likes his job - a job that he eventually loses . He announces to his audience that he broke up with Hanka - which is how Ond & # 345 ; ej learns about the news that make him very happy . Finally , Ond & # 345 ; ej 's wife Lenka is always ready to forgive him and stabilize their marriage - even after Ond & # 345 ; ej asks a magician to make him disappear so that Ond & # 345 ; ej can try to capture Hanka again . ( The magician pays his debt because he is a brother of a victim of an important car accident - Jakub and Hanka bring the victim to the hospital and Ond & # 345 ; ej saves his life . ) Lenka also works for the travel agency - as a translator - and eventually she has to translate some hysterical scenes for 20 or so Japanese tourists who are shooting their movies during Hanka parents ' dinner . The seven characters interact in interesting and exciting ways that would be natural if Prague were smaller by four orders of magnitude . Given the actual size of the Czech capital , it looks a bit unlikely that all these events would take place among seven people , but it is fun .
`` Cinderella '' is a film about a young girl whose mother passed away and her father remarried . Once her father died , Cinderella 's stepmother became very mean to her and made her do all of the chores around the house , like cleaning up after her two evil stepsisters . One day the King sent out a message to all of the single women to attend the Royal Ball in honor of his son , to find a wife . Of course , Cinderella did n't get to go , but her stepsisters did . Cinderella was very upset and thought that there was no way she could attend the Royal Ball , until her fairy godmother appeared . So she did some magic and made Cinderella into a beautiful woman , but she had to be back by midnight because that is when the magic changes back . While at the Royal Ball , Cinderella loses track of time and the clock strikes midnight , so she runs out of the palace and loses her glass slipper . Then the King orders the duke to find the women who wore that slipper . The duke searched every house , but finally found the women who it belonged to , Cinderella . Clyde Geronimi , Wilfred Jackson , and Hamilton Luske directed one of the best animated Disney films in 1950 . This film is about a magical fairytale . In the beginning of the film Cinderella was a servant to her own family and had nobody to love her , but with a little bit of magic her whole life changed around and finally found love . My favorite thing about `` Cinderella '' is the music . When Cinderella 's fairy godmother appeared doing her magic , she sang the song Bibbidi Bobbidi Boo . When I was a child , it was one of my favorite songs to sing around my house , so I will never forget it . I also loved the part when Cinderella and the Prince were singing the song So This is Love while they were dancing because they realized that they are in love . Overall this film was my favorite film when I was a little child because every little girl wants to live a fairy tale life .
This movie was a fantastic comedy . It had a lot of comedians star in it like Akshay Kumar , Rajpal Yadav , Paresh Raval and John Abraham . Rimi Sen was good at playing Akshay Kumars wife and so were all the air hostesses . Mr Hot as Mac ( Akshay Kumar ) and Mr cool as Sam ( John Abraham ) are two fashion photographers who like the same girl Maggie ( Neha Dupia ) . When John Abraham cheats on his work he becomes Akshay Kumars senior and Akshay Kumar gets really jealous because his flat has to be given to John Abraham and Neha Dupia starts liking John more . Akshay Kumar wants to be better than John Abraham so he finds a flat and he is going out with three different girls ( Nitu Chandra , Nargis Bagheri , Daisy Boppana ) .
Thank the Lord for Martin Scorsese , and his love of the movies . This is the perfect introduction into the mind of the most talented American artist working in cinema today , and I could n't recommend it more . I was enthralled through the whole thing and you will be too . Just relax and let him take you on a ride through his world , you 'll love it .
I have just seen this film , and fallen in love with it . There is a little bit of something for everyone , and its a particular free for all when it comes to the romance between Lachlan and Lil . When they are on the beach , I nearly cried ... there is the unspoken realization that time is the most precious commodity and it is most evident when they are together . This idea taken from several angles , from marriage to sibblings to finding love in the least conventional of places . The film almost makes you long for that kind of desperation when you know that tomorrow could very well be your last . Crowe was particularly wonderful in his role of Lachlan . I 've always had a soft spot for the accent , but I nearly melted with his portrayal of his character . The way this film was shot is also beautiful , with the music , backdrop of the open fields , and superb acting . All together , this is a wonderful film that tugs at all of human emotions .
Sur mes lèvres or READ MY LIPS is fine little thriller that also examines the lives of 'outsiders ' , people who live in the periphery of our vision who struggle with the need to 'fit in ' . Director Jacques Audiard with and co-writer Tonino Benacquista have created a tense , tight , completely entertaining little thriller that makes some significant statements about out of the norm individuals and their plights . Carla ( Emmanuelle Devos ) is a plain Jane , mostly deaf , thirty something unnoticed secretary for a company whose life is one of social and sexual isolation and whose view of the future is rather bleak . Enter Paul ( Vincent Cassel ) a recent released ex-con parolee who responds to an ad to be Carla 's assistant . There is a mutual physical repulsion at first meeting : Carla had hoped for a well-groomed , genteel man who might fulfill her fantasies and Paul is a coarse , unkempt sleazy guy who is not impressed with being a clerk . Their concepts change rather quickly when Paul salvages Carla 's job by filling her request to steal a letter that would cost her her job and Paul discovers Carla 's lip reading ability which he sees as a way to spy on the criminals from his past who threaten his life for money owed . So this odd couple of a team join forces and together enter a dangerous suspense filled ploy to gain Paul 's safety and freedom . The relationship is full of twists and edge of the seat suspense with each of these unlikely characters fulfilling roles in their lives that fill the chinks in their walls of isolation in surprising ways . Devos and Cassel deliver bravura performances and the remainder of the cast is uniformly strong . Once again Alexandre Desplat has produced a musical score that enhances the tension and cinematographer Mathieu Vadepied finds all the right lighting and angles to suggest the worlds of isolation of the characters as well as the Hitchcockian sense of suspense . Director Audiard wisely manipulates a factor that is at once sensitive and transformative for the story : he shows us the difference between 'hearing ' the world with and without hearing aids and in doing so makes some powerful social comments . This is a fine film that remains in the ranks of the best of the French film noir genre . Recommended . Grady Harp
This is by far my favorite film of all time . That 's mainly because it 's not afraid to delve into some very politically incorrect topics ( such as spanking and female submissiveness ) that other mainstream films are just too timid to touch . Nothing seems to be off-limits in this film as the director freely develops the story without any concern given to possibly offending the viewer . However , I do n't think anything was done here purely for shock value or to purposely offend anyone . Sean Young turns in an excellent and courageous performance . Most established mainstream actresses would not have taken on this role or would have asked for some major script changes before accepting it . The other cast members do a fine job as well . Have you noticed that this movie has n't appeared on pay cable since an obligatory brief run a year after it hit the theaters ? Have you ever wondered why ? The obvious reason is that it just does n't fit today 's political atmosphere . It seems quite ironic to me that some premium channels now carry softcore porn ( that 's getting closer and closer to hardcore porn ) but will not carry a mainstream movie like `` Love Crimes '' . Sadly , even though this movie is only 11 years old , it could probably not be made today .
This was the second of two filmed `` Hamlets '' in the nineties , the first being Franco Zeffirelli 's , starring Mel Gibson , from 1990 . Zeffirelli 's version , like Laurence Olivier 's from 1948 , was based upon an abridged version of the play , with much of Shakespeare 's original text being cut . ( I have never seen Tony Richardson 's 1969 version , but as that ran to less than two hours , shorter even than Zeffirelli 's , I presume that was also abridged ) . Kenneth Branagh was attempting something much more ambitious- a film based on the complete text of the play , with a running time of around four hours . With his `` Henry V '' , Branagh claimed Olivier 's crown as the cinema 's leading Shakespearean , confirming his claim with his brilliant `` Much Ado about Nothing '' , a rare example of a great film based on a Shakespeare comedy . `` Hamlet '' was his third Shakespeare film as director ( he also acted as Iago in Oliver Parker 's 1995 `` Othello '' ) and , as one might expect , it is very different to `` Much Ado . '' . The earlier film , shot in a villa in the hills of Tuscany and the beautiful surrounding countryside , is a joyous , summertime film about everything that makes life worth living . `` Hamlet '' , by contrast is set in the depths of winter . ( The flowers in the description of Ophelia 's death suggest that Shakespeare himself thought of the action happening in summer ) . The look of the film is particularly striking , both sumptuous and chilly . It was filmed at Blenheim Palace , possibly England 's most grandiose stately home , but also a rather forbidding one . The snowy exterior scenes are cold and wintry ; the interior ones formal and elaborate . The action is updated to the mid nineteenth century ; the female characters wear the elaborate fashions of that era , while the principal male ones mostly wear splendid military uniforms . ( There is a contrast here with Zeffirelli 's film , where both the interiors and the costumes were deliberately subdued in tone ) . The play is dominated by images of corruption and decay ; Branagh 's intention may have been to contrast a splendid surface with the underlying `` something rotten in the state of Denmark '' . The film is notable for the large number of big-name actors , some of them in very minor roles . ( Blink , and you might miss John Gieldgud or Judi Dench ) . Apparently , an all-star cast was required by the production company , who were nervous about a four-hour film . Some of the imported Hollywood stars , such as Robin Williams ' Osric , did not really come off , but others , like Charlton Heston 's Player King or Billy Crystal 's First Gravedigger , played their parts very well . Yorick , normally only seen as a skull , is here seen in flashback , played by the British comedian Ken Dodd . Brian Blessed , who often plays jovial characters , is cast against type as the Ghost , and makes the scenes in which he appears genuinely frightening . Of the major characters , perhaps the weakest was Kate Winslet 's Ophelia . Branagh 's leading lady in his first two Shakespeare films was his then wife Emma Thompson , but their marriage ended in divorce in 1995 . I did , however , find myself wishing that Thompson had been cast in the role ; although Winslet came into her own in the Ophelia 's mad scenes , she seemed weak in the earlier ones where her character is still sane . ( I preferred Helena Bonham Carter in Zeffirelli 's version ) . Richard Briers plays Polonius with a greater dignity than he is often given , a wise and experienced counsellor rather than a prating old fool . Julie Christie also brings dignity to the role of Gertrude ; there is no attempt here , as there was with Gibson and Glenn Close in the Zeffirelli version , to suggest an incestuous attachment between her and Hamlet . ( An interpretation which owes more to Freud than it does to Shakespeare ) . The age difference between Christie and Branagh is great enough for them to be credible as mother and son , which was certainly not the case with Close and Gibson . ( Olivier 's Gertrude , Eileen Herlie , was , bizarrely , thirteen years younger than him ) . Branagh stated that his intention in restoring those scenes which are often cut in cinematic versions was to `` reinforce the idea that the play is about a national as well as domestic tragedy . '' Much stress is placed upon the war with Norway and the Norwegian Prince Fortinbras- a subplot ignored altogether by Zeffirelli . This emphasis on national tragedy is perhaps best shown in the character of Claudius , sometimes played as a one-dimensional villain . There is something about Derek Jacobi 's performance which suggests that Claudius could have been a good man under different circumstances , but that he allowed himself to be led astray by ambition and lust . He could have been a good and loyal servant to his brother , but chose to rule as a bad king . Although he is tormented by guilt , he can see no way to make amends for the evil he has done . Branagh , a wonderfully fluent speaker of Shakespeare 's verse , is superb in the main role . Like Gibson , he has little time for the old concept of Hamlet as indecisive , passive and melancholy . His is an active , physical , energetic Hamlet , something best shown in his fatal duel with Laertes . His guiding principle is not world-weary despair , but an active disgust with evil and corruption . It was a gamble for Branagh to make a four-hour epic , and the film did not do well at the box office . It was , however , praised by many critics , James Berardinelli being particularly enthusiastic . My own opinion is that , whatever the financial returns may have been , Branagh 's gamble paid off in artistic terms . By concentrating on the full text , he was able to bring out the full meaning and full emotional power of Shakespeare 's most complex play . When I reviewed his `` Much Ado `` , I said it was the greatest ever film of a Shakespeare comedy . His `` Hamlet '' may just be the greatest ever film of a Shakespeare tragedy . 10/10
As perhaps one of the few Canadians who did not read the book in high school , I thought I would add my comments . Seeing the movie without knowing the story beforehand in no way detracted from the film . The characters have so many complexities , everyone can relate to them in their own way . The brilliance of the adaptation is that everyone is allowed to project their own perceptions onto the lives of the characters , rather than being spoon-fed an opinion . You can love them or dislike them , and still feel the emotional impact of the movie . Wonderful performances by Ellen Burstyn and Christine Horne really bring the characters to life . I 'd highly recommend it .
Usually , when we use the word `` escapist '' , we mean it negatively ; Warren Beatty 's big screen version of `` Dick Tracy '' proves that `` escapist '' can be good . This is truly one entertaining movie . As the eponymous , yellow-clad , fearless title character , Beatty creates a detective to whom we can all relate : ready for action , but not without his weaknesses . From there , the rest of characters are almost a world unto themselves . Tess Truehart ( Glenne Headly ) is as glamorous as one would expect the hubby of any crime fighter to be ; Breathless Mahoney ( Madonna ) is possibly the most perplexing person imaginable ; Big Boy Caprice ( Al Pacino ) is the average villain : ruthless but cool . Other characters include the speech-challenged Mumbles ( Dustin Hoffman ) , the over-musical 88 Keys ( Mandy Patinkin ) , and The Kid ( Charlie Korsmo ) . Charles Durning , James Caan , Dick Van Dyke , Estelle Parsons , Catherine O'Hara , Seymour Cassel , Paul Sorvino and Kathy Bates also star . Oh , wait a minute . I have n't even explained the plot ! The plot involves Tracy trying - and failing so far - to find some way to nab Big Boy . Simultaneously , some very bizarre events have been going on in town , the answers to which may or may not be closer than everyone thinks . Of course , the main thing about this movie is that it 's fun to watch . If Warren Beatty was having trouble acting his age , then he made good use of that here . `` Dick Tracy '' is one cool movie .
This was an adorable movie . A real feel-good movie when you need one . The story is light ( this is no Gone With the Wind ) but sometimes , one needs this kind of plot . Funny and warm characters , fantastic acting and beautiful costumes/wardrobe . Parminder K. Nagra ( also from the TV show ER ) is WONDERFUL in this role . She is definitely a new shining star for Hollywood . All should keep an eye on her , she 's going to be BIG in the future . Also impressing was the soundtrack for this movie . A nice mix of modern and Indian tunes . I was dancing throughout most of the movie . Highly recommended if a fun movie is what you need .
Shot into car from through the windscreen , someone is playing someone else their latest song , someone else did n't react , according to the voice-over . I just wonder how that came to be made . There were too many scenes in this movie that I wondered about how come a camera was there . If the scenes shot where the Warhols descended on a BJM post-party are true then that was inexcusable exploitation to the max , if not , then it was a total fabrication , either way it made me uncomfortable , if that was the purpose ? All the way thru this movie I kept wondering how the footage came about . Taken at face value , a nice portrait of the ( tortured ) genius we all believe ourselves to be .
I used to watch Pufnstuf every weekend when I was about 10 . It was on right after Bay City Rollers . I saw it come on to Family Channel one day , and taped it for my then three-year old daughter . I 'd forgotten all the things I 'd loved as a child , the magic flute , the zoom broom , Witcheepoo 's makeup . This show is decidedly low tech . The mayor is surely a precedent to Mayor McCheese , and everyone is a stuffed creature with annoying googly eyes . But kids love this stuff . They would way , way rather watch a guy work a sock puppet than sit in front of high-tech computer animation . There is ( mild ) slapstick , but no adult themes such as sex or people dying , and kids accept Jimmy 's schemes . Kids think it would be neat to carry a bag of smoke around and convince someone their house was on fire , and I loved how every time my daughter saw a jet stream in the sky she thought Witchypoo was flying overhead . The music is old , but you really get used to it , and my daughter really loved it . She used to sing `` different is hard , different is lonely '' in the car . My daughter watched this show at least once a day for about 5 months , and it 's still one of her favourites . I see that a new Pufnstuf 2000 is in the works . I really hope they try to keep the old flavour and do n't do anything like computer-animating characters etc . I think a whole new generation would love Pufnstuf .
To be honest , I did n't like that much this movie when I saw it for the first time . But I guess the trouble is that I have n't seen it in a theater . Big Mistake ! Because the # 1 thing to see in Cliffhanger is the settings and # 2 is the cinematography . Try to see this movie on the largest TV possible and a great sound system . The music is good and puts the movie to a higher level ( and a commercial potential ) . The more I see it , the more I like it . It 's definitely one of Renny Harlin 's best movie . THis guy knows about action . Die Hard 2 , The long kiss good bye , etc . And it 's particularly good in this movie . The special effect are great and spectacular . Stallone really needed that movie get back with success . Still good to see him !
I showed this to my 6th grade class about 17 years ago and the students loved it . I loved it , too . The story of the termites and their interaction with their environment is amazing . The cast of creatures is deep and they all play their parts well . The battle between the two cold-blooded titans is truly classic footage . Alan Root has done some incredible camera work and this should have won the Best Documentary Oscar . The copy I have does n't have Orson Welles narrating it ( Derek Jacobi ) and it is n't called the `` Mysterious Castles of Clay , '' just `` Castles of Clay . '' This makes me think that it must have been done with Welles added for star power and an Oscar push . I was lucky enough to find this VHS just recently and it is now my children 's favorite movie . They brought it to the latest family gathering instead of a Disney movie . If you can find this movie you are indeed lucky .
I love this film . It is well written and acted and has good cinematography . The story blends action , humor , mysticism , and tenderness with great sets and beautiful location shots . See it , buy it , show it to your friends . The acting is good and Murphy especially does a fine job portraying the reluctant/unlikely hero . I enjoyed all the characters and found them to be interesting and well developed with dynamic interactions . I cared what happened to these people and , while the outcome was pretty predictable ( the good guys win , the hero gets the astonishingly attractive girl and the holy child saves lives -- who does n't see that coming ? ) , it still made me happy when everything worked out well in the end . Thank God this film 's dignity was never ruined with a crappy sequel . Grab some popcorn , cuddle up on the couch , and watch this fun , happy and entertaining film .
I first saw this film 40 years ago on N.Y. television , and thought it was a depressing look at the future . Wells sees restriction of private freedoms as a good thing . ( `` no private airplanes '' . The 30 year plus war in the film was the reason this film was not shown to British film goers doing the war . The concept of the future , and the Korda an Co. concept of the the machines of the future are the real stars of the film . The very best acting performance is that of Ralph Richardson as the Boss . A combination of Winston Churchill and Edina from Absolutely Fabulous comedy series . It is interesting to note that the Boss 's negative personality is somewhat similar to the war time Churchill .
This is the second Eytan Fox film I have seen . The fantastic actor , Lior Ashkenazi , who starred in Walk on Water , has a minor role in this film also . But the real stars are the young Israelis who live together in a tiny apartment - Noam ( Ohad Knoller ) , Lulu ( Daniela Virtzer ) , and Yelli ( Alon Friedman ) ; and the Palestinian that joins them off and on - Ashraf ( Yousef 'Joe ' Sweid ) . There is sort of a Friends/Sex in the City thing going on ( mostly gay ) , and they all just want the war to end so they can go on with their lives in peace . But , that 's the rub . No matter how many posters you put up or how many raves for peace you have , the war is not going to end . Many have tried over the years to bring the two sides to the table , but they just want to keep it going for whatever reason . There are many on the Israeli side , both there and here in the US , who just want it all and will not consider peace . There are many on the Palestinian side who apparently would be out of a job should peace ever come . It is in no one 's interest to end this war , and the children suffer . This is always on your mind as you watch this funny and engaging film . It wo n't go away . You know something tragic is going to happen and , of course , it does . With the feelings on both sides running strong , and revenge as the motivator , tragedy always happens , and that is what makes this an adult version of Friends/Sex in the City . There is no superficiality . It is real life , and it was a beautiful thing to see .
One of the most important artistic movements in the history of cinema was without a doubt German expressionism , the highly atmospheric style of film-making developed during the 20s in Berlin . Classic movies like `` Das Cabinet Des Dr . Caligari . '' ( 1920 ) and `` Nosferatu , Eine Symphonie Des Grauens '' ( 1922 ) were the most famous direct results of this movement , and while the movement did n't have a long life , its enormous influence over cinema can still be felt today , specially in the horror genre . One of the key figures of this style would be director Paul Wegener , director of 1920 's `` Der Golem , Wie Er in die Welt Kam '' , as in his debut as a filmmaker , seven years before the making of that classic , he was already making experiments with expressionism in film . That early prototype of German expressionism was incidentally , another horror film : `` Der Student Von Prag '' . `` Der Student Von Prag '' ( `` The Student of Prague '' ) , is the story of Balduin ( Paul Wegener ) , a student with the reputation of being the best fencer in Prague , but who always find himself with financial troubles . One day , Balduin rescues the beautiful countess Margit ( Grete Berger ) from drowning in a lake after her horse drop her by accident . Balduin falls immediately in love with her and tries to see her again , but soon he discovers that he 'll have to compete with her rich cousin , Graf Von Schwarzenberg ( Lothar Körner ) , who also wants to marry her . Knowing that he ca n't offer her much , Balduin wishes to be wealthy , and this is where a sorcerer named Scapinelli ( John Gottowt ) enters the scene . Scapinelli offers Balduin infinite wealth in exchange of whatever he finds in his room . Balduin accepts the proposal , only to discover in horror that what Scapinelli wants is his reflection in the mirror . Loosely inspired by Edgar Allan Poe 's short story `` William Wilson '' and the classic legend of `` Faust '' , the story of `` Der Student Von Prag '' was conceived by German writer Hanns Heinz Ewers , a master of horror literature and one of the first writers to consider scriptwriting as valid as any other form of literature . Written at a time where cinema in Germany was still being developed as an art form , `` Der Student Von Prag '' shows a real willingness to actually use cinema to tell a fully developed story beyond a camera trick or a series of scenes . Like most of the scriptwriters of his time , Ewers screenplay is still very influenced by theater , although `` Der Student Von Prag '' begins to move away from that style . While a bit poor on its character development ( specially on the supporting characters ) , Ewers manages to create an interesting and complex protagonist in the person of Balduin . While `` Der Student Von Prag '' was Paul Wegener 's directorial debut and Stellan Rye 's second film as a filmmaker , it 's very clear that these two pioneers had a very good idea of what cinema could do when done properly . Giving great use to Guido Seeber 's cinematography , the two young filmmakers create a powerful Gothic atmosphere that forecasts what the German filmmakers of the following decade would do . Wegener would learn many of the techniques he would employ in his `` Golem '' series from Seeber and Rye . Despite having very limited resources , Rye and Wegener manage to create an amazing and very convincing ( for its time ) visual effect for the scenes with Balduin 's reflection ( played by Wegener too ) . Already an experienced stage actor at the time of making this film , Wegener directs the cast with great talent and also attempts to move away from the stagy style of previous filmmakers . As Balduin , Paul Wegener is very effective and probably the best in the movie . It certainly helps that his character is the only one fully developed by the writer , but one ca n't deny that Wegener was very good in his role as the poor student who loses more than his mirror reflection in that contract . John Gottowt plays the sinister Scapinelli with mysterious aura that suits the character like a glove . Few is said about Scapinelli in the film , but Gottowt makes sure to let us know that he is a force to be feared . The rest of the main cast is less lucky , with Grete Berger being pretty much average as countess Margit , and Lothar Körner making a poor Graf Von Schwarzenberg . However , it must be said that Lyda Salmonova was pretty good in her expressive character and Fritz Weidemann made an excellent Baron Waldis-Schwarzenberg , showing the dignity that Lörner 's character should have had . Considering the movies that were being done in those years in other countries and the fact that its remake ( made 13 years after this film ) is superior in every possible way , it 's not difficult to understand why `` Der Student Von Prag '' has n't stood the test of time as well as other early films . The movie 's main problem is definitely its extremely low budget , as it resulted in the film being considerably shorter than what Ewers ' story needed to be fully developed . This makes the plot feel a bit too vague at times , or even incomplete , as if there was something missing in the narrative ( of course , there 's also the possibility that the existing print is really incomplete ) . However , `` Der Student Von Prag '' is a very interesting early attempt at a complex tale of horror and suspense in film that , while inferior to what other filmmakers were doing at the time , left a powerful impression in history . As the direct predecessor of the German expressionist movement , it 's hard to deny the enormous importance that `` Der Student Von Prag '' has in the history of German cinema , probably in the history of cinema in general . It may look dated even for its time , but considering the limited resources its director had , it 's truly better than most films from that era . As the movie that started Paul Wegener 's career , and with that German expressionism , `` Der Student Von Prag '' is a must see for everyone interested in this slice of film history . 7/10
Scream was Wes Craven 's last decent thriller . Since then there has been nothing but an unbearable streak of Hollywood trash barely good enough for a blockbuster night , including the disappointment of the Scream sequels . Perhaps the genius and the craftsmanship devoted to the movie drained all the energy and creativity out of him , so that when it came time for supper , he had nothing to serve us but his own doo doo . Finally , after who knows how many bad movies later , he gives us a delicious , ruthless , gripping , chilling suspense thriller with Red Eye . Rachel McAdams once again delivers an enjoyable performance as she plays a hotel manager who has the unfortunate connection with an important political figure and regular at her hotel . Then she meets Jackson Ripner ( Cillian Murphy , Batman Beyond ) at the airport , who she gets to know a little better after a delayed flight and a bay breeze . What she does n't know is he already knows her . And he also knows her father , who she will never see again if she fails to cooperate and meet Jackson 's demands- to use her connections to set up her hotel regular for assassination . You 're probably thinking this is nothing but your everyday thriller complete with predictability and chase scenes . Although this is a good old fashioned thriller , that 's the beauty of it . No special effects . No cheap make up . Just classic suspense . You feel the desperation and regret with every decision McAdams is forced to make and you actually care for her as you cheer her on every move she makes to find an escape from her claustrophobic position . As always she delivers an entertaining and convincing performance . It 's either her sweet face or her uncanny ability to sincerely cry , but you always seem to sympathize with her if her role demands it . Cillian Murphy on the other hand is naturally creepy looking , so even if the trailer did n't reveal it , his ultimate transition from charming stranger to merciless jackass is n't so surprising . Perhaps it would have been more trippy to see a nice guy persona like Toby Maguire transforming into evil relentless madman . Nevertheless , Cillian Murphy , after his true identity is established , played the role so solidly you 'd really want him to die , or at least get his ass kicked . Do n't overlook this feature . There are plenty of chalkboard screeching moments and heart jumpers that will keep your eyes on the screen instead of your watch like you would at Craven 's recent pictures . If not for the you , do it for all the times you 'll see your girlfriend , or boyfriend , or someone with popcorn jump and cling on to you . Wes finally gets it right . Aside from his trademark mastery in suspense , Red Eye is not without its humor as McAdams ' replacement Cynthia at the front desk fumbles to keep the hotel in order . It was a relief that Red Eye was n't a disappointment . Instead you 'll get the pleasure of seeing McAdams deliver another incredibly talented performance , Murphy look creepier by the minute , and Craven craft a classic traditional thriller . A flight that was delayed and would have been the beginning of Craven 's renaissance had it arrived right after Scream .
Ealing Studios , a television and film production company based in West London , claims to be the oldest film studio in the world . Though it has been consistently churning out films and television programmes since the 1930s , its golden age was most certainly between 1948 and 1955 , when it produced a string of comedy masterpieces , many starring the great Alec Guinness . Such well-known titles include 'Whisky Galore ! ( 1949 ) , ' 'Passport to Pimlico ( 1949 ) , ' 'Kind Hearts and Coronets ( 1949 ) , ' 'The Lavender Hill Mob ( 1951 ) , ' 'The Titfield Thunderbolt ( 1953 ) ' and 'The Ladykillers ( 1955 ) . ' One of Ealing Studio 's most beloved films , 'The Man in the White Suit , ' was released in 1951 , and starred Alec Guiness as Sidney Stratton , a brilliant inventor who engineers a remarkable fabric , an invention that unexpectedly makes him more enemies than friends . Sidney Stratton is poor and unappreciated , but he has scientific talent in great abundance . Due to his under-qualification , the only jobs he is able to get are as a janitor or labourer at any of the large textile factories , where he secretly undertakes his own experiments using the company 's own money and equipment . After being found out and ejected countless times , Sidney is convinced that he is only weeks away from a momentous scientific discovery that will revolutionise the textiles industry . Encouraged by his daughter Daphne ( Joan Greenwood ) , textile mill owner Alan Birnley ( Cecil Parker ) takes a keen interest in Sidney 's exploits and agrees to finance any further work . After numerous failed attempts and quite a few earth-shattering explosions , Sidney eventually unveils his amazing creation : an almost-luminous white fabric that never gets dirty and never wears out . If Sidney thought that his invention would make him a hero , then he was sorely disappointed . The all-powerful bosses of textiles industry , headed by the frail Sir John Kierlaw ( Ernest Thesiger ) , unite to ensure that the revolutionary invention , which could completely cripple their businesses , never goes into full-scale production . Likewise , the humble labourers in the workers ' union hear of Sidney 's creation and also set out to erase it from existence , fearing for their jobs . The inventor , however , is convinced that the ever-lasting fabric will bring relief and happiness to many , and refuses to give in to the demand of others , despite being threatened with violence and offered ₤250,000 in compensation . Throughout all his troubles to announce his invention to the media , only one person offers Sidney her complete sympathy and support , Birnley 's daughter Daphne , who is engaged to be married to somebody else but falls in love with Sidney 's plight anyway . 'The Man in the White Suit ' is a clever and hilarious comedy , made great by a witty script ( written by John Dighton , Roger MacDougall and director Alexander Mackendrick ) and a quirky and charismatic performance from an inimitable Alec Guinness . There are also a few good-natured swipes at capitalism , and of how big industries can hold back progress for the sake of their own monetary situations , though we can certainly see the arguments for either side of the debate .
`` The House That Dripped Blood '' is one of the better anthology films of the time period . **SPOILERS** Tracking down a missing film star , Inspector Holloway , ( John Bennett ) finds that the last reported sighting was in a large mansion in the countryside . During the course of looking through the house , he is told four different stories about past residents of the house . The Good Story ( s ) : Method for Murder-Moving into the mysterious manor to get some peace and quiet while Charles pens his latest masterwork , Horror novelist Charles Hillyer , ( Denholm Elliott ) and his wife Alice , ( Joanna Dunham ) are thrilled with the story , which centers around a serial strangler named Dominic . After a series of strange accidents and experiences in the house , Charles begins to believe that the creation my have come to life and is haunting him and his wife . Probably one of the better entries in the film , it 's easily the creepiest . The atmosphere here is what sets it apart . The scenes with the fictional character are genuinely creepy , the mystery surrounding him is really effective and there 's always a classic creep-out moment . The classic moment is the kill in the psychiatrist 's office , which is an all-time high for creepiness . The build-up to it , with the creaking sounds , quick flashes of a mysterious being , and the thunder and lightning in the back ground work well for this one 's favor . Sweets for the Sweet-Moving into a new house , widower John Reid , ( Christopher Lee ) hires former school teacher Ann Norton , ( Nyree Dawn Porter ) for his young daughter Jane , ( Chloe Franks ) while he 's away on business . Ann gradually begins to unravel a dark secret from Jane 's past , which John vehemently denies . When she learns the true nature of what has happened , it 's far more shocking that what she could 've thought possible . With the creepiest outright plot and the biggest twist of the stories , this is a quite pleasant entry . The mystery of the family is wonderfully played out , with small amounts of clues piled up here and there , and the final revelation is downright nerve-wracking . That part alone is the main reason why this one works , and Lee does n't harm it either . The Bad Story ( s ) : Waxwork-Tortured by memories of his lost love , Phillip Grayson , ( Peter Cushing ) and his friend Neville Rogers , ( Joss Ackland ) both become infatuated with a statue of a woman in a Wax Museum , as the statue takes over their lives , they discover a shocking secret about the museum that haunts the both of them . There 's a clever premise here , and it does provide an excuse to spend time in a wax museum , which are always creepy . This is no exception , and it looks eerie , which is helped by the florescent lighting on display on the sculptures . A dream sequence provides a great moment of suspense , but what ultimately kills this one is the slow pace . It takes a long time for events to unfold out , and most of the time is spent on exposition . It also builds up to a shock ending that can be seen coming from a mile away . Those really lower this one a bit . Had the twist been changed , it would 've scored higher , the rest is acceptable . The Cloak-Veteran horror film actor Paul Henderson , ( Jon Pertwee ) upset at the lack of realism on the set of his new film , goes off and buys a new vampire cloak from a specialty store . The cloak soon turns him into a vampire , going crazy on the set with co-star Carla , ( Ingrid Pitt ) and other vampiric acts at home . Unconvinced the cloak is the cause , he does everything he can to prove it 's just in his imagination . This has a pretty decent premise , and there is plenty of opportunity for some decent scares , but what sinks it is several factors . First , it 's just too goofy for it 's own good . The plot twist at the end is a perfect example , which is so overdone that it 's not really a shock at all , and just comes across as just plain silly . There 's so few scenes of scares or attempted scares that it 's just a bore to sit through . It 's the weakest one in the film . The Final Verdict : A quite decent omnibus film , there 's a few small problems scattered through each of the stories that renders this a less than perfect but still highly watchable film . Highly recommended for those into the similar films at the time or who enjoy British horror films . Today 's Rating-PG-13 : Violence
Before this little black-and-whiter , the touchy topic of criminal rape never made it onto the American screen.There were lots of these topics that Hollywood and the Production Code kept hidden until the rebellious 1960 's . So it 's not surprising that it would take a little independent company like Ida Lupino 's Filmmakers to raise the subject . The result is well-meaning but somewhat compromised , which is not surprising since director Lupino had to work with Code demands to get the movie released . Interestingly , Ann Walton 's ( Mala Powers ) main problem following the assault is not how others might see her , but how she sees herself . And it 's a heavy load she 's carrying . Will she ever be able to relate to men again ? Will they look at her as `` spoiled goods '' ( after all , this is 1950 ) ? Small wonder she runs away rather than face these anxieties at home and at work , even though family and friends are generally supportive . Overall , this first part is earnest and well-done . The chase is hyped to inject some action into the plot , but then this is a movie -- notice how the incurious neighbor fails to respond to the honking horn near chase 's end . Had those been screams of alarm from Powers instead , the neighbor 's lack of response would have raised an interesting albeit complicating issue . The second half is pretty much given over to the Production Code in the sentimentalized person of Rev . Ferguson ( Tod Andrews ) . It 's he ( to quote a phrase ) who `` gives her courage to face life again '' . There 's some effort at humanizing him -- is it Ann or her dilemma that he 's most interested in . Still , his gentle and understanding presence comes across as a little too miraculous and a little too Hollywood . Fortunately , the ending avoids the usual Hollywood cop-out by emphasizing only the hope of a happy resolution for Ann rather than its certainty . Give Lupino a ton of credit for dealing with the topic in the first place . Given the overall results , I expect she dealt as honestly with the topic as she was allowed to . I also expect today 's audiences find the treatment mildly interesting mainly because of Powers ' excellent performance that brings out the purely human drama . However , the film works best now as a document of its time , and what the cultural watchdogs of that day thought was appropriate for adult viewing .
Watching Cliffhanger makes me nostalgic for the early '90s , a time when virtually every new action movie could be described as `` Die Hard in a /on a . '' Cliffhanger is `` Die Hard on a mountain , '' and pretty good , for what it is . But unlike Passenger 57 and Under Siege , which are decent Die Hard clones on their own terms , Cliffhanger dispenses with the enclosed feeling of many action movies and embraces breathtaking landscapes that , in their immensity , threaten to overwhelm and trivialize the conflicts of the people fighting and dying among the peaks . Years before other movies like A Simple Plan and Fargo dramatized crime and murder on snowbound locations , Cliffhanger director Renny Harlin recognized the visual impact of juxtaposing brutal violence and grim struggles to survive against cold and indifferent natural surroundings . The opening sequence has already received substantial praise , all of which it deserves : its intensity allows us to forget the artifice of the camera and the actors and simply believe that what we are seeing is actually happening . Not even Harlin 's shot of the falling stuffed animal , which is powerfully effective but still threatens to become too much of a joke ( and which he repeated in Deep Blue Sea ) , or the ridiculous expression on Ralph Waite 's face , can dim the sequence 's power . The next impressive set-piece is the gunfight and heist aboard the jet . As written by Stallone and Michael France and directed by Harlin , the audience is plunged into the action by not initially knowing which agents are involved in the theft and which are not : the bloody double-crosses are completely unexpected . As Roger Ebert has observed , the stuntman who made the mid-air transfer between the planes deserves some special recognition . Later , during the avalanche sequence , one of the terrorists/thieves appears to be actually falling as the wall of snow carries him down the mountain . So far as I know , no one was killed in the making of this movie ( a small miracle , considering the extreme nature of some of the stunts ) , so obviously a dummy was used for the shot . But the shot itself remains impressive because we 're left wondering how Harlin ( or more likely one of the second-unit directors ) knew exactly where to place the camera . I 'll take Sly Stallone as my action hero any day of the week , because he 's one of the few movie stars I 've ever seen who 's completely convincing as someone who can withstand a lot of physical and emotional pain , and at the same time actually feels that pain . The role of Gabe Walker really complements Stallone 's acting strengths : he plays an older , more vulnerable kind of action hero , giving an impressively low-key performance as a mountain rescuer who must redeem himself . In contrast to many of today 's post-Matrix , comic book-inspired action heroes , Stallone 's Walker is an ordinary man who becomes a hero without any paranormal or computer-enhanced abilities . In Cliffhanger , the hero almost freezes to death , and his clothes start to show big tears as he barely escapes one dangerous situation after another . He winces when he 's hit and bleeds when he 's cut , particularly in the cavern sequence when he takes a Rocky-style pummeling from one of the mad-dog villains . It should be noted that the utterly despicable villains really contribute to the movie 's effectiveness : when I first saw this movie as a teenager , I was rooting for the good guys every step of the way and anticipating when another bad guy would bite the dust ( or rather , the ice ) ; at one point I actually cheered as one of the most cold-blooded characters in the movie deservedly suffered a violent demise . Lithgow 's British accent is as unconvincing as the movie 's occasional model plane or model helicopter , but he 's fundamentally a good actor , and one of the few who can perfectly recite silly dialogue : in one scene , looking at his hostages Stallone and Rooker , trying to decide which tasks to give them , he actually says `` You , stay ! You , fetch ! '' Even a better actor , such as Anthony Hopkins , might have had trouble with that line . Even if Cliffhanger occasionally tosses credibility aside , it does so only for the sake of a more entertaining show . Early in the movie , for example , Lithgow openly says to one of his men `` Retire [ Stallone ] when he comes down . '' No real criminal mastermind would have made this mistake even unconsciously : his carelessness allows Rooker to shout a warning up to Sly on the rock face , and this precipitates a gripping tug-of-war between Stallone and the bad guys trying to pull him down by the rope tied to his leg . Lithgow could have given his order by a more subtle means , but the sequence might not have been as much fun to watch if it had n't given Rooker an opportunity to openly defy the arrogance of his captor . Done very much in the style of a Saturday matinee serial or ( at times ) a Western , Cliffhanger is built on such a solid foundation that it survives some weak elements that would have undermined a lesser film . Besides the painfully obvious aircraft models mentioned before , the weak moments include a couple of scenes shot on cheap indoor sets with REALLY fake snow , as well as two other scenes involving bats and wolves that seem unnecessary in an already action-packed narrative . Finally , Harlin 's decision to film some of the death scenes in slow motion seems pointless , since the technique contributes nothing to the scenes . It 's a shame that Stallone is now too old for action movies , because his character in this movie seems so credible that inevitably I wonder what he would be like years later . But perhaps it 's best that Cliffhanger stands on its own for all time , without a sequel : there are enough tired and obsolete movie franchises already . There was an unofficial sequel that called itself Vertical Limit : compared to that clinker , Cliffhanger belongs on the IMDb 's Top 250 list . Rating : 8 ( Very good , especially considering most of Stallone 's other movies . )
I thought that this film was very well made , Heath Leger was very convincing and his Irish accent was flawless . Orlando Bloom and Naomi Watts were also really good and believable . How true it is to what really happened I have no idea , but it did portray why people sometimes become what they do . Maybe those in authority have always been corrupt and I did find it interesting that over 30,000 signed a petition for Ned Kelly NOT to be hanged , so maybe there was more truth in this film than at first thought ? In many ways it reminded me of Cold Mountain which was another good historical film . All in all I would highly recommend this film and I am somewhat baffled why it did n't do better in the cinemas .
I bought the DVD of Before Sunset and saw it for the first time a week ago . Having saw it twice , I could n't help but missing Before Sunrise , not because the sequel was not as great , but I felt that these two movies completed each other like no other sequels ever did , every time I finished watching one of them , I feel the need and yearning to see the other . So , I ended up spending the weeks watching both of them repeatedly , I will be quite embarrassed to mention how many times exactly . The most remarkable thing about Before Sunrise is how you feel the development of the feelings of their characters towards each other . It sounds so simple , the growing of the chemistry , I think other romantic films might think that they succeed to track the development , but to me - who does n't believe in Nora Ephron - Before Sunrise is the first film to really gives the viewers chance to feel it . When I saw it for the first time , about 8 year ago when I was 20 , I already liked it . But , I did n't rate it as a `` great film '' , it still seemed to me like another thinking persons ' feel good movie , Linklater was too smart to make it more realistic , it was 10 minutes too long , the characters was too well fabricated , I thought I liked it because it was like a dream and because I enjoyed their conversations , etc . etc.. But now , thanks to Before Sunset , I feel that 's more to Before Sunrise than what I felt for it before . I saw the elements more clearly : Jesse , Celine , Vienna , their conversations , everything . How each of them are separated element by itself , and they have a chance to mix , the story is just a frame of time , I am no longer feel manipulated . And the freedom that every scene has , as well as its refusal to be overly efficient , how blind I was that those qualities did n't strike me as exceptional when I first saw it ! Now , 8 year have passed , the more movies I 've seen , the more I realize that many movies are just collections of ordered scenes that only exist for the sake of its ending , even movies like Pulp Fiction or Linklaters 's own Slackers included . The Jesse and Celine tale avoid that , maybe Before Sunset is a better example in this case , but Before Sunrise is also one of few films that its ending is just a consequence of time , not a destination , every single scene has its own life . I do n't know whether Linklater or anyone else had a sequel in mind when they made Before Sunrise , but to me , one of the most amazing things about these sequels are how these two films visually contrast each other . Before Sunrise which I think employs more static angels and brighter color schemes , seems to try to capture the smallest atoms of liveliness surrounding Jesse and Celine , the world is always full of hope whether or not the characters feel it . Meanwhile , I enter the vision of boredom as Jesse stuck talking to the journalists in Before Sunset , and Celine 's first smile from behind the shelves are the most heartbreaking smile I 've seen in a beginning of a film , and the many moving shots after that takes me to a place I do n't know with a sadness in me , no matter how beautiful Paris is , and no matter how happy I am that they meet again . I 'm sorry that I go on this long with my limited English , Before Sunrise is already an extraordinary film without me pouring my scattered thoughts , and it gets even better with an equally great sequel following it .
The movie `` Atlantis : The Lost Empire '' is a shining gem in the rubble of films produced by the Disney Studios recently . Parents who have had to sit through `` The Jungle Book 2 '' or even a Pokemon movie will surely appreciate this one . The film is one of few to attempt at an original story ; previous feature films were merely re tellings of existing stories . Films such as `` Toy Story '' , `` Finding Nemo '' , and `` Monsters Inc. '' all do the same , but it must be noted that all were made by Pixar and only distributed by Disney . Recent films from the Disney Studios are mostly released direct to video , and are sequels to an existing successful film . The quality of those films is given way to the profitability . A new era started with `` Atlantis '' following it were `` Mulan '' , `` Lilo & Stitch '' , and most recently `` Open Range '' . The writers have created all original story lines instead of the fairy tales of the past . A good portion of the movie is devoted to the quest to find Atlantis , a task that has captured the imagination of many for hundreds of years . Including that of young Milo Thatch , voiced by Michael J . Fox . Milo is employed by a museum in Washington D.C.. His grandfather was a renowned archaeologist , who had devoted his life to discovering Atlantis . This was seen as a waste by his peers , and they wish Milo to not follow in his footsteps . After failing to convince the museum board of directors to sponsor his expedition , Milo comes home to find a woman in his darkened apartment . She takes him to her employer , a Mr. Whitmore . Whitmore was a close friend of Milo 's grandfather , and wishes to send Milo with a team to locate Atlantis . Mr. Whitmore is very wealth and has paid for the best of everything . The crew that is to accompany him is the same as his grandfathers . The journey is filled with many great obstacles to overcome and is great fun to watch . The viewer finds themselves caught up in if they will reach Atlantis . The plot takes an unexpected turn after the discovery Atlantis , not just the discovery of people . It is enough to keep the interest of the older audience . The animators have done a wonderful job in then depth of the animation . The movie is very successful in blending traditional animation with Computer Generated Images . A feat not easily achieved , most audiences are quick to notice the difference in the two . The characters are believably human . There are some nice chase type scenes , with lots of action going on . A few lulls are filled with jokes that the children just may not get . The creativity of the writers really shines through . The culture of Atlantis is richly developed , including an entire language . The film uses references to Atlantis from historical sources , such as Plato . The disappearance of Atlantis from the world is explained . Believable , if by a younger audience , that magic really does exist . The powers of the people of Atlantis are not exactly presented as magic , but can best be described in this way . Although set in 1914 the level of technology used is unrealistic . The voyage is in a submarine very reminiscent of Captain Nemo 's nautilus , complete with sub pods that fire torpedoes . The giant diggers are driven by steam boilers so they did try for some era technology . The female characters are empowered in a way that women of the age would not have been , even holding roles in leadership . This is not a bad thing . It gives a good role model for my daughter to look to , rather than an all male cast . One reason this film is a favorite of mine over other Disney films is that there is not one single song , ever . A tradition that began with the first feature film , `` Snow White '' , and carried on through to `` The Lion King '' , almost every Disney film is full of upbeat songs . This is great and all , what would the Seven Dwarfs be without `` Hi HO ! '' ? After the millionth time through it 'd almost be better without , but this one spares the parent . Not once does every single person on the screen suddenly know the words to a song that no one has ever heard before and break out in song . I for one am grateful . The storyline and depth of animation is sure to keep the attention of both parent and child alike . It is a film I am willing to watch again and again with my children .

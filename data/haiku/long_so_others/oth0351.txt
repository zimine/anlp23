WHERE IS GOD?

I went into the forest seeking God. 
I looked up at the trees, 
Tall, straight, aspiring, 
Not needing God.
    
I went down to the sea 
And watched the waves 
Rolling relentlessly, 
Indifferent to God.
    
I saw two wrens love-making,
Twittering and chirping shrilly in the sun,
Not bothering about God.
    
A woman's arms were around me, 
Upon her breast I slept 
And forgot I wanted God: 
She gave me - a little, 
But - where is God?

JOY

He swings upon the high green boughs of life 
Up to the stars and down.
	Curious about the noisy earth
He parts the leaves to look. 
He has the face of a child
	Aloof and whimsical 
Hearing the slow complaint 
Of rheumatism and old age. 
Mischief clears the puzzled brows
	He shakes the tree. . . . .
Oh the glittering scented shower. . . . 
Oh the enraptured quiet. . . .

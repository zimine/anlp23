TO STATECRAFT EMBALMED

There is nothing to be said for you. Guard 
Your secret. Conceal it under your "hard 
	Plumage," necromancer.
		O
Bird; whose "tents" were "awnings of Egyptian 
Yarn," shall Justice' faint, zigzag inscription -  
	Leaning like a dancer -  
		Show
The pulse of its once vivid sovereignty?
You say not, and transmigrating from the
	Sarcophagus, you wind 
		Snow
Silence round us and with moribund talk,
Half limping and half ladified, you stalk
	About. Ibis, we find 
		No
Virtue in you - alive and yet so dumb.
Discreet behavior is not now the sum
	Of statesmanlike good sense. 
		Though
It were the incarnation of dead grace?
As if a death mask ever could replace
	Life's faulty excellence! 
		Slow
To remark the steep, too strict proportion
Of your throne, you'll see the wrenched distortion
	Of suicidal dreams. 
		Go
Staggering toward itself and with its bill, 
Attack its own identity, until
	Foe seems friend and friend seems 
		Foe.

PORTRAIT OF A WOMAN IN BED

There's my things 
drying in the corner: 
that blue skirt 
joined to the grey skirt -  
I'm sick of trouble!

Lift the covers
if you want me
and you'll see
the rest of my clothes - 
though it would be cold
lying with nothing on!

I won't work
And I've no cash.
What are you going to do
about it?
- and no jewelry -  
(the crazy fools!)

But I've my two eyes 
and a smooth face 
and here's this! look! 
it's high!
There's blood and brains
in there - 
my name's Robitza!

Corsets
can go to the devil - 
and drawers along with them!
What do I care!

My two boys? 
- they're keen! 
Let the rich lady 
care for them -  
they'll beat the school 
or
let them go to the gutter -  
that ends trouble.

This house was empty -  
wasn't it? 
Then it's mine 
because I need it.

Oh I won't starve 
while there's the Bible 
to make them feed me.

Try to help me 
if you want trouble 
or leave me alone -  
that ends trouble.

The county physician 
is a damned fool 
and you 
can go to hell!

You could have closed the door
when you came in;
do it when you go out.
I'm tired.

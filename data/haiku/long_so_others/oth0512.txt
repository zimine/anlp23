TO W - 

Not a word. I love you even now as I have never loved -  
even now, 
even you.
Yet not a word to me.

It is too late. Your letter did not give me one small thrill, even
	though it seemed that you were thrilled. 
It came as the light of candles comes, though of candles that are
	brought to a feast 
after the guests have met in darkness and have dispersed. 
The feast that I prepared for you has long since soured, cold,
	untouched, 
and flies 
and moths
swarm in the light you bring to me - 
many flies, 
many moths.

It is too late. Candles at dawn are ghastly, and I am at the dawn 
		of another day; 
	quiet dawn. 
Do not speak.
Know that my love for you is like the vast, hot light that spreads 
	abroad, these days, upon the mighty, rolling, ploughed and 
	harrowed hills beside the dread, majestic Kennebec.
Know that my love for you is as constant, as virile, as strong, as the 		beaming flood that bears that name.
Yet not a word to me.

OPUS 344

	My lust of roundness will betray me 
To the arms of God, some day.

	And I shall feel that I have cheated the Devil 
If at the end of life
I have concealed from him how well I could be
	tempted 
By triangles.

	As for the rest, my whole life seems a long 
Effort to circumvent and overleap 
And crawl beneath all manner of polygons, 
Squares, rhomboids, parallelograms. 
At night I dream that cubes are crushing me; 
And a free octagon, if I should meet it, 
Would strike me dead.

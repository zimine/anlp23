DESIRE

Once you were always calling me,
Calling me when I could not answer,
Urging me where I could not follow - 
So that I wished I had been born without desire,
As a stone.

But now many days you have left me,
And in the silence I have learned your meaning.

For a part of me is gone when you are gone; 
I am less
And the world is less.

O let me have my longing back again! 
Now gladly I will bear it; 
Gladly I will hold it to me, 
Though without release; 
Always.

For what would be the pride of the sun itself
With its light gone?
O kindle me again, desire.
Return to me.
Return.

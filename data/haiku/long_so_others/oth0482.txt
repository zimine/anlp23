ARABS

Melancholy lieth dolorously ill,
one heel full fatally smitten:
Melancholy twitcheth and sigheth:
'Must such as I, because of an itch,
move from the cheery sloth of a couch,
from watching my valorous nomad musings
coming and passing like pilgrims en route
from mooning philosophy on to the sun - 
must such as I, almost ready to follow them,
legs follow musings like sheep follow bells - 
must such as I, because of a scratch
imprinted by small, ignominious teeth
of a small, black, common, effeminate witch,
surely not one of my bidding - move?
What way is this, God, to make a man move?'
And his bed-fellow,
Happiness, petrified, groaneth:
'What way is this, God, to make a man stone?'

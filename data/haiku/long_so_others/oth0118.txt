THE PUBLIC LIBRARY

A mausoleum,
Of stained marble and gilded trappings,
Of spacious vaults and shadowed silences
Broken, only, by the hollow echo
Of hurrying foot-steps.
In certain chambers,
Tier upon tier of shelves,
Like miniature unsealed graves,
Bear at rest
The tiny coffins of paper and cloth: 
The final abode of mortal thought. 
And here, the ghouls -  
Mute, furtive and light-of-foot -  
Prowl about;
Peering into the barren homes of the dead 
For precious words to help the living.

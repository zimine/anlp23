DORA NORTHERN

I met her at her aunt's. 
She was psychic sunshine 
And somatic witchery.

She was from Kentucky,
And returned to Kentucky 
Where she died;
But her sunshine did not go into the grave.

She had a heart to love you with,
But she liked to turn coquette,
Now and then, in the midst of her love.

We sat on the sofa one night,
The philter of her smile
Went straight to the citadel of my heart.

I surrendered for that night,
She knew it was just for that night.

She was listening while I talked: 
"We will build us a house," I said, 
"A little log-cabin, you know, 
Back of some man's cornfield, 
On the creek, in the woods.

We will whitewash it
And plant ivy around the door,
Which will climb up the wall
And drop down in big green clusters.

You can raise chickens
And I'll raise hogs
And we'll drink creek-water
And live in perfect bliss and ignorance."

She deftly clasped her magnetic hands
Which lay in her virgin lap
And leaned nearer to me
With her pretty face atilt
And smiled coquettishly and said,
"In my imagination
 I can see that beautiful little home."

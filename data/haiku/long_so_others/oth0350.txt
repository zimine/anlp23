C.S.

I cry out I am one of the people,
I belong to the masses,
I live with them, sweat with them,
Eat their bread and share their hunger,
Bear on my back their burdens
And in my soul their grief:
    
Then - 
I write
And write and write and write 
For you to listen, 
Listen and falter:
    
I sing of their quick-snatched joys
Of the abundant life, - 
Living and loving, giving birth and dying,
That goes on in the east side,
And you in your swivel chair
You turn sick with envy!
    
I proclaim
I am one with the people -  
And all the while I know 
I am a thousand million miles 
Beyond you and the people.

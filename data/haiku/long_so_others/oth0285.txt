STREETS

Rows of exact, streaked faces,
Each afraid to be unlike the others,
(O bare, yellow houses let me batter different shapes
	into you, 
With cracked knuckles!)

Glass globes on signs and in shops, with a light not 
	your own,
Recalling small souls that festoon the streets of my
	remembrance. 
(O let me place you between large thumbs, 
And break you to showers of falling splinters and
	sparks!)

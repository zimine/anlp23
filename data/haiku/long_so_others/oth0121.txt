TRACT

I will teach you 
my townspeople 
how to perform 
a funeral -  
for you have it 
over a troop of artists - 
unless one should
scour the world - 
you have the ground sense
necessary.
See! the hearse leads 
I begin with 
a design for a hearse. 
For Christ's sake 
not black -  
nor white either -  
and not polished! 
Let it be weathered - 
like a farm wagon -  
with gilt wheels 
(this could be 
applied fresh 
at small expense) 
or no wheels at all 
a rough dray to 
drag over the ground. 
Knock the glass out! 
My God - glass, 
my townspeople! 
For what purpose? 
Is it for the dead 
to look out or 
for us to see 
how well he is housed 
or to see
the flowers or
the lack of them - 
or what?
To keep the rain 
and snow from him?
he will have a 
heavier rain soon -  
pebbles and dirt 
and what not -  
let there be no glass 
and no upholstery 
phew!
And no little
brass rollers
and small easy wheels
on the bottom - 
my townspeople
what are you thinking of?
A rough
plain hearse then 
with gilt wheels 
and no top at all. 
On this the coffin lies 
by its own weight. 
No wreaths please -  
especially no 
hot house flowers. 
Some common memento 
is better
something he prized
and is known by:
his old clothes - 
a few books perhaps
God knows what!
You realize
how we are
about these things
my townspeople - 
something will be found - 
anything
even flowers
if he had to come to that.
So much
for the hearse - 
for heaven's sake tho'
see to the driver!
Take off
the silk hat!
In fact that's no place
at all for him - 
up there
unceremoniously
dragging our friend out
to his own dignity.
Bring him down - 
bring him down!
Low and inconspicuous!
I'd not have him ride
on the wagon at all -  
damn him -
the undertaker's
understrapper!
Let him hold the reins
and walk at the side
and inconspicuously too.
Then briefly
as to yourselves:
walk behind - 
as they do in France,
seventh class, or
if you ride
Hell take curtains!
Go with some show
of inconvenience - 
sit openly - 
to the weather
as to grief.
Or do you think
you can shut grief in - 
what - from us?
We who have perhaps
nothing to lose?
Share with us
share with us - 
it will be money
in your pocket - 
remember that, and
this:
there is one land - 
and your two feet
are sucked down
so hard on it that
you cannot raise them - 
where men are
truly equal
for they all have
nothing.
Go now, I think 
you are ready

LILLIAN

She's a little rustic beauty 
In the quaint village of my boyhood, 
But the simplicity of her manner 
Pleases me
Since I've returned from the city
For a brief visit,
Having eluded the charms
Of accomplished women
With a bit of dash and adventure.

She is younger than I am, 
Being a minoress. 
I reached my majority 
Two years ago.

Her flavicomous head
Reaches to my shoulder.
I like to look down into her blue eyes
While she looks up into my face.

Sunday afternoon,
With some of her chums and some of mine,
We sauntered down to the spring,
Just below the bridge.
She sat down on the elevated platform
Of concrete
And let her feet dangle over the edge
Of the enfonced tile,
While the water, from the iron-pipe
Below,
Trickled into the creek.

Her silken hose betrayed
The symmetry of her crus,
The comeliness of her ankle.
I looked at her and smiled and said,
"Oh, that I were a sculptor."
Then waggishly I looked - well, into the spring.
She smiled, blushed a little,
Then shifted her position.

I can't say that she's in love with me,
Although, I'm sure, that my waggery,
Manifested now and then,
And my city ways
Appeal to her as a novelty.
I can't say that I'm deeply in love with her.
But I admire the little rustic beauty;
For the simplicity of her manner
Pleases me.

THE JOURNEY

Dog-like you accepted caresses
But your body and your soul lay curled
Waiting . . .
    
Then with your frail torso,
With your soft flesh,
With your feet less strong than iron
You set out on your journeys - 
Your eyes of gleaming gold
And the smile about your mouth
Like white foam.
    
I admired you.
    
But when I caught a glimpse
Of the hand behind you - 
The big ruthless hand,
I did not know whether to admire
Or to pity you.
I almost blamed you
Like other folk.

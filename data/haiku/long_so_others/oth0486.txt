DREAMS

	What is so sweet to a man of Ethiopia as the golden brown 
arms of a woman he loves, caressing him in the night?
	What is so sweet to a man of Ethiopia as the honeyed 
words she whispers to him when the moonlight is falling 
on the bed?
	What is so sweet to a man of Ethiopia as the virgin cry 
of a dusk brown baby? 
	Life is a Pandora box of dreams.

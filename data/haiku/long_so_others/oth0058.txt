LES OMBRES DE LA MER

I grieve my dream:
My dream that was like a golden lacquered bowl, 
My dream that was coloured like a Chinese print.
A wave of the sea has been here: 
Muffled bells and red 
Sea-stained gold:
Green flames under the foam,
The blue shadows darting like fishes.
Tread softly:
Do not cleave the air with Thy presence, 
I guard my dead from the waters.

IMPRESSIONS OF A WOMAN

The dipping road she walked on 
Had a still fringe of raised-lipped people, 
Whose eyes spread out like dying water-drops, 
As they gasped at her dress of braided moon-thread 
And her face, a silken window laced with cold 
	flames . . .

Thus did she seem to me
As we met upon one of the hill-tops of our lives.

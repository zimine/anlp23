WOOD FEAR

Suddenly, 
Far off,
The lights drew away; 
The path stood still.
Out of the dark, 
Noiseless, ominous,
The trunks of the trees towering came toward me;
Lifted themselves
Out of the dark into a great height
And came toward me.
Near,
Crowding upon me,
Closing in upon me like a wall of menace.

The long boughs stretched out to reach me; 
They leaned toward me, through the blackness, 
Slanting, 
Slanting
To fall upon me. . . . . . . .

But now in a moment
The darkness grew light;
The boughs of the trees sank from the sky,
And were as before;
And I was walking as before
Quietly
Along the accustomed path 
In the shadows.

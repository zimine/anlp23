NEW PRELUDE

I know only the bare rocks 
	of to-day.
In these lies my brown sea-weed, 
green quartz-veins bent through
	the wet shale; 
in these lie my pools left
	by the tide -  
quiet, forgetting waves; 
on these stiffen white star-fish; 
On these I slip barefooted!

Whispers of the fishy air
	touch my body: 
"Sisters!" I say to them.

MY SECRET

Old Vassalboro sleeps upon the hills 
beside the Kennebec, where it has slept 
through many quiet years.
					For the first time,
but yesterday, I passed along the road 
that forms its only street. At either hand 
a few great houses dozed beneath great elms
 drowsy witn morning dampness and June heat. 
Such is the ancient village. It is like 
an aged woman nodding on a porch. 
I passed as reverently as if I passed 
some aged woman nodding on a porch,
for, at one hand, I saw the ruined cellar of a great, old house that
	burned, last spring - 
the homestead of a blood I will not name;
and, as I passed,
I looked for a graveyard
in which is buried
a woman whose name I should not utter
lest it be heard by another woman.
It is because I love both women.
Below,
afar,
stretched the vast valley in a passionate haze,
a verdant expanse of lovely declivities
grand with the sight
of ancient farms
of long established opulence.
I cannot utter the name of the woman
who must have looked across that valley
scores, hundreds of times,
dreaming, perhaps of me.

Little pinks, I hope, are growing on her grave.
I hope the birds sing, often, near the mound - 
the warbler, 
the catbird - 
and I know that I should bring some flowers, sometimes, when I
	can, and place them against the stone that bears the name I 
	cannot utter.

THE COTTON PICKER

Like the arm of a child, lifting shining lilies from a
					little brown pond,
The sunlight drew songs from a lithe, grimacing negress
Whose skin was smoother than the cloudless sky
					above her . . .
The flecks of cotton they picked
Brought a changing white stupor to the tepid-faced
					women about her,
And her shoulders fell as slowly as the sun above her. 
Yet the pent satin of her face was always cut by a smile, 
As she hummed of a joyous Christ.

TO A SOLITARY DISCIPLE

Rather notice, mon cher, 
that the moon is 
tilted above
the point of the steeple 
than that its color 
is shell-pink. 
Rather observe
that it is early morning
than that the sky
is smooth
as a turquoise.
Rather grasp
how the dark
converging lines
of the steeple
meet at the pinnacle - ;
perceive how
its little ornament
tries to stop them!
See how it fails!
See how the converging lines
of the hexagonal spire
escape upward
receding, dividing!
- sepals
that guard and contain
the flower!
Observe
how motionless
the eaten moon
lies in the protecting lines.
It is true:
in the light colors
of the morning
brown-stone and slate
shine orange and dark blue
but observe
the oppressive weight
of the squat edifice!
observe
the jasmine lightness 
of the moon!

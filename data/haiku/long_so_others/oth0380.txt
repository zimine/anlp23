CHINESE NEW YEAR

Mrs. Sung has a new kitchen-god.

The old one‚Äîhe who has presided over the house-
	hold this twelvemonth - has returned to the 
	Celestial Regions to make his report.

Before she burned him Mrs. Sung smeared his
	mouth with sugar; so that doubtless the re-
	port will be favorable.

Now she has a new god.

As she paid ten coppers for him he is handsomely 
	painted and should be highly efficacious.

So there is rejoicing in the house of Mrs. Sung.

TIDAL GOSSIP

With a kick of white lace
The ruffled waves
Flirt to the winking sun;
Minding not
	the stodgy sleeper, 
Whose eye	is turned inward 
Upon intestinal ructions.

(Despite the fact, 
He is their consort.)

But then,
One must do something 
To turn the flying edge 
of the sickle, 
While waiting
	the cold sweet lover,
Whose head
	on a silver platter 
Makes terrible the night.

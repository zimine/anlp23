NIGHT

I make my prayer to the night;
The vast, the mystical night.
And all things in time will do homage with me.
With what joy my thoughts dwell on the night;
The soundless fathomless night.
I do not fear the night
Nor the death that shall bring the night to me; 
My absolute, my quiet night.

There is no truth greater than that of night;
After all there is night;
Night with dark and mystery.
A thousand million stars shall blaze on the night,
Still shall my night reign supreme.
A thousand million tongues shall wail on the night,
Still shall my night silent be.
O vast and mystical night,
Beloved of space and strange-eyed worlds,
What homage do I pay unto thee!
With utter prostration I worship at thy shrine;
Thou art my bed, my grave, my all,
For earth has no home for me.
The foolish trees, the crawling life;
Bastard things of time and chance,
Are but repulsive to me: - 
Therefore I make my home in the night.
In my night there is truth;
In my night there is simplicity:
Space woos my night with fathomless love,
And I also feel the seduction of space.
I love its sweeping sensation on my mind;
I love the madness of heart that it confers on me.
In space there is no tomorrow to haunt me
Nor today to disgust me: - 
Therefore I make my home in the night.
There is quiet in my night,
And my night questions not;
There is rest in my night,
Rest and simplicity: - 
Therefore I make my home in the night.
And when thou hast come, O night,
And swept my little me
Into thy strange mantle of oblivion,
Give one great moment of thy supreme silence
Wherein to damn the little tinkering mind of men
Into a sense of its own inconsequence.

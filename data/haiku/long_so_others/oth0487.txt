ROUND EYES

We are not so 
lonely in the city 
when we glide 
down granite dusk 
and people flit, mothlike, 
about us with enquiring 
great round eyes. 
Should we touch them 
They would vanish, 
and leave us, two colossi, 
face to face 
with the smoke-red 
evening star.

And yet I think I might
be happier if I could
reach out a subtle finger
from my shell
and crack through yours,
or twine a finger
like city smoke around
the evening star,
and hold the star to you,
and touch you,
see you shiver white
without fading into
some far doorway in the dusk,
a tailored ghost.

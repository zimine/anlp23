TO W.C.W.M.D.

Use black japalac on your coffins, 
W. C. W. M. D. 
Long before the cemetery dirge 
it dries,
there is no shine, 
it mummifies death 
as black should do. 
His religion isn't black, 
some nuance
harmonious with the nose of the deceased - 
on some boxes
a baby blue would do,
but not on yours. On yours
yellow and orange nasturtium
with a grain of red earth!
And a design, sir,
six lanky grasshoppers
with knees and toes a-jump - 
W. C. W. M. D.,
on yours let's have a design!

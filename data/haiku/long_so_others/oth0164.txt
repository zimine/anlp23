"WALRUS BAY"


High banks with a hard feel to them 
Stand up from a slow plash of gray waves. 
Humped rocks too
And looking twice at the humped rocks
We see they are not walrus playing tag
As we guessed at first.
No life of blood, throat and nostril
Runs under them; they are granite
Heaved up years ago to companion the sea.

YOUNG GIRLS

You also love smell of leaves, 
Keen wind, 
And golden sunshine 
Through green valleys: 
But they are not for you.

Your souls are like wet flowers, 
Bathed in kisses and blood. 
All you know
Is to burn, tremble, and yearn: 
Golden Clyties, 
The wheel of light 
Rushes over your breasts.

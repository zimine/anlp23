EPITHALAMION - A DANCE TO WORDS

			First bridesmaid speaks:
    
The little yellow flower
The silver girl
With bubbling shower
Of curl on falling curl
On breast of slippery pearl
With mouth of little baby child
And eyes by passion half beguiled
That droop afraid to show
The little that they know
Of boy
And joy
Is now a golden statue, a fair bride,
The petals of her virgin heart spread wide.
    
			Second bridesmaid speaks: 
So motionless 
she stands 
With quiet feet and hands 
Her mouth is now a woman's mouth 
Her eyes are wise with instinct law
Her soul perceives what Eve first saw 
In East and West, in North and South 
In budding root 
In pregnant fruit, 
The good of Life
The marriage love of man and wife.

			Third bridesmaid speaks:
The little nymph ran deep in wood 
And where a weeping willow stood 
With tearful leaves on sighing boughs 
She hung with parted lips 
And finger tips
Pressed warm on dewy brows -  
But he the hunter came 
Made heaven loud with her name 
And caught the little downy thing 
With body sweet as spring 
And suddenly, how could it be? 
She was a prouder thing than he 
For he must take while she will give 
The future god for which they live -  
Happy husband, kiss her now 
On fiery lips and frozen brow -

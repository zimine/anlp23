K. MCD.

You exquisite chunk of mud,
Kathleen - just like
any other chunk of mud
- especially in April!
Curl up round their shoes
when they try to step on you,
spoil the polish!
I shall laugh till I am sick
at their amazement.
Do they expect the ground to be
always solid?
Give them the slip then
let them sit in you
soil their pants,
teach them a dignity
that is dignity, the dignity
of mud!
	Lie basking in
the sun then - fast asleep! 
Even become dust on occasion.

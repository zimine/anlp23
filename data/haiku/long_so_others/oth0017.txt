THE COMING OF NIGHT

The sun is near set 
And the tall buildings 
Become teeth
Tearing bloodily at the sky's throat; 
The blank wall by my window 
Becomes night sky over the marshes 
When there is no moon, and no wind. 
And little fishes splash in the pools.
        
I had lit my candle to make a song for you.
But I have forgotten it for I am very tired;
And the candle. . . a yellow moth. . .
Flutters, flutters,
Deep in my brain.
My song was about, 'a foreign lady
Who was beautiful and sad,
Who was forsaken, and who died
A thousand years ago.'
But the cracked cup at my elbow,
With dregs of tea in it,
Fixes my tired thought more surely
Than the song I made for you and forgot. . .
That I might give you this.

I am tired. 

I am so tired
That my soul is a great plain 
Made desolate,
And the beating of a million hearts 
Is but the whisper of night winds 
Blowing across it.

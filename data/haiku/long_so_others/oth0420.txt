BLOSSOMS

Charge the blast furnace, workman, 
Open the valves, 
Drive the fires high. 
(Night is above the gates.)

How golden-hot the ore is 
From the cupola spurting, 
Tossing the flaming petals 
Over the silt and the furnace ash. . . 
Blown leaves devastating, 
Falling about the world. . .

Out of the furnace mouth - 
Out of the giant mouth - 
The raging turgid mouth - 
Fall fiery blossoms,
Gold with the gold of buttercups
In a field at sunset,
Or huskier gold of dandelions
Warmed in sun-leavings,
Or changing to the paler hue
At the creamy hearts of primroses.

Charge the converter, workman -  
Tired from the long night? 
But the earth shall suck up darkness, 
The earth that holds so much. . . 
And out of these molten flowers 
Shall shape the heavy fruit. . .

Then open the valves, 
Drive the fires high, 
Your blossoms nurturing. 
(Day is at the gates 
And a young wind. . . )

Put by your rod, comrade,
And look with me, shading your eyes
Do you not see - 
Through the lucent haze
Out of the converter rising - 
In the spirals of fire
Smiting and blinding,
A shadowy shape,
White as a flame of sacrifice,
Like a lily swaying?

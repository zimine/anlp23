THE CHAMELEON

	What happened yesterday? 
What terror drove me here to hide away
     	Grey 
Under a stone? 
My lizard soul needs warmth,
     	Light, color. 
It brightens into beauty in the sun. 
I will go out again to the dappled earth,
     	To the gold, to the blue, to the green -  
Never mind tomorrow's 
Or yesterday's dim sorrow 
That drove me here to hide alone
     	Grey under a stone.

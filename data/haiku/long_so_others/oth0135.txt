A SWORD

A million-bladed sword,
slashing the petty pates
and sticking the smug stomachs of the past
till the pink blood dribble
and, with a roar of ribald song,
a whirlwind of naked dance,
flaunting the laughing boyish present on a pike
against the stare and whisper of the doddering future
a sword is love!

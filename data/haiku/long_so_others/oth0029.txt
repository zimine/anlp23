THE VAGABOND IN THE PARK

They sit upon little benches, lips slack, eye-lids blinking
Like flapping white shades in the windows of empty
						rooms.
The trees over them, shift their lace with rushing,
					smothered laughs, 
And speak of the nakedness to come.
But the straight, shining women under the trees
Have never known what it is to take off dust-painted
						clothes.

TO DIVERSE CONTEMPORARIES

			1.
The roots of old thoughts blossom underground,
Achieve a putative and dark fruition:
The pollen of imagined passions
Sprinkles dead leaves of grass,
Which rustle drily
To the wind's perverted lashings;
And all the weather-cocks point north
Or south or east or west
At your mere breathing;
Beauty has reached its menopause
And sleeps serenely sterile - 
Tho its dreams are teeming.

			2.
O holy scarab,
Squatting upon the mantle-shelf
With wise antennae raised
To the admiration of the drawing-room,
Does no one know
That you have been
Upon the village road,
Rolling dung-balls
In the morning sun,
With other tumble-bugs?

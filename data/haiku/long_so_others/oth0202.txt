And Death came,
Stealing in on tip toe
Like a Thief.
And went away, smiling,
Like a Victor.
Waving one long bony arm,
While the other gripped
His Victim close,
Like a miser.
He left the door wide open.
In the doorway stood a woman.
Her eyes were dry.
She stared into the distance,
And could see nothing.
Like the Future.
She turned
And saw the leaden skies.
Here and there a glint of gold,
Like the Past.
And she saw
The wasted years.
Of the Dead.
And of the living dead.
Like in a Dream.
And she dreamed
Of Peace,
And she hoped
For Rest.
And she prayed
For Death. 
Like a Vision. 
To be met,
With outstretched Arms 
Like a Lover.

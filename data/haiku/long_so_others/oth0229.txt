OPUS 11

	This is a true 
Spectrum 
Of Elijah Hay.

	The first time, 
I saw a Van Dyck beard -  
With nothing under it.

	The second time, 
I saw a round nose
With nostrils as delicately curled 
As the cup of an acorn, 
And a mouth faintly pursed 
As for a taste of timothy, 
And eyes that bubbled under glass: 
A face with thoughts in it 
Like trout in a field.

	Such a difference 
Comes 
Of a razor.

THE WHIP OF THE UNBORN

It is not she who rends me so -  
no, it is not she.
These eves are not hers that hate me so - 
no, they are not hers.
Nor this her breath that flaunts me,
nor these her arms that strangle - 
no, these are not hers.

It is not I who rends me so -  
no, it is not I.
This heart is not mine that goads me on - 
no, this is not mine.
Nor these my thoughts that flay me,
nor this my soul that sneers me down - 
no, these are not mine.

Nor that her whip that lashes me, 
nor that my whip that lashes me -  
no, this is not ours.

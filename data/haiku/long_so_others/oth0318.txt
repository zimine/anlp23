THE CUP

If he were sober 
he would love you
as you wish to be loved 
and as he would love you 
if his muddled thought of you 
were clear of desire.

It is sad
that one so young 
should be drunken so soon, 
but, dear worthy child, 
had you not answered him, 
had you not answered him - 

I know, 
I know
it wasn't your fault.

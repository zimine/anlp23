LEAFLESS

You are so straight and still.
What does it mean?
Are you concerned
in the tops of you now
with sky matters
and winter butterflies?
Do not the leaves you colored 
trouble you longer?
Try and recall!

Try and recall:
(over this path
she used to tread her way,
over there
I used to throne them for her, 
green, brown, red, yellow!)

Did you look at me? 
Did you say something?

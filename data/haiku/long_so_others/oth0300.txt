SPRING SONG

Having died
one is at great advantage 
over his fellows -  
one can pretend.

And so, - 
the smell of earth
being upon you too - 
I pretend
there is
something
temptingly foreign,
some subtle difference,
one last amour
to be divided for
our death-necklaces, when - 
I would merely lie
hand in hand in the dirt with you.

STOLEN

I crept slyly 
to your table
. . . Oo . . . m 
Sugared peaches drowned in chianti . . .
    
Destiny
shaped heavily like a nurse girl 
yanked me by the ear 
planked me in my high chair. 
"There" said she 
"Eat what is set before you 
Impudence."
    
Oh bread and butter 
flat every-dayness 
monotony 
milk.

IDYL

Out of the sea
Brown glance sparkling
To me in laughter
Under pencilled scimitars,
Brown hair grown deep
On ribbon of brow,
Cheeks claret and cream,
Nose (did your mother wink at a Jew?
Oh, handsome Jew!),
But - 
Mouth the bow that Cupid bent.

Out of the sea,
Out of the sea
Forgetfulness,
Respite of every suffering
For slimness
Burnished of Biscayan sun -  
Miracle's creaky joints unbend, 
Doddering pander a yearling prances, 
Fie on the jubilation! -  
And war, and war - 

Love is now that,
O sea and Biscayan sun!

Youth.

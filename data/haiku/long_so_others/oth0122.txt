TOUCHE

The murderer's little daughter 
who is barely ten years old 
jerks her shoulders 
right and left
so as to catch a glimpse of me
without turning round.
Her skinny little arms
wrap themselves
this way then that
reversely about her body!
Nervously
she crushes her straw hat
about her eyes
and tilts her head
to deepen the shadow - 
smiling excitedly!
As best she can
she hides herself
in the full sunlight
her cordy legs writhing
beneath the little flowered dress
that leaves them bare
from mid-thigh to ankle - 
Why has she chosen me
for the knife
that darts along her smile?

LOVE SONGS

			I
    
Spawn of fantasies
Sitting the appraisable
Pig Cupid	his rosy snout
Rooting erotic garbage
"Once upon a time"
Pulls a weed	white star-topped
Among wild oats sown in mucous membrane
I would 	an eye in a Bengal light
Eternity in a sky-rocket
Constellations in an ocean
Whose rivers run no fresher
Than a trickle of saliva
    
There are suspect places
    
I must live in my lantern 
Trimming subliminal flicker 
Virginal 	to the bellows
Of experience
		Colored glass.

			II
    
		The skin-sack 
In which a wanton duality 
Packed
All the completions of my infructuous impulses
Something the shape of a man
To the casual vulgarity of the merely observant
More of a clock-work mechanism
Running down against time
To which I am not paced
	My finger-tips are numb from fretting your hair 
A God's door-mat
	On the threshold of your mind.
    
			III
    
We might have coupled
In the bed-ridden monopoly of a moment
Or broken flesh with one another
At the profane communion table
Where wine is spilled on promiscuous lips
    
We might have given birth to a butterfly
With the daily news
Printed in blood on its wings.

			IV
    
Once in a mezzanino
The starry ceiling
Vaulted an unimaginable family
Bird-like abortions
With human throats
And wisdom's eyes
Who wore lamp-shade red dresses
And woolen hair
    
One bore a baby
In a padded porte-enfant
Tied with a sarsanet ribbon
To her goose's wings
But for the abominable shadows
I would have lived
Among their fearful furniture
To teach them to tell me their secrets
For I had guessed mine
That if I should find YOU
And bring you with me
The brood would be swept clean out.

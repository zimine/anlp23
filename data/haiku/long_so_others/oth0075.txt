SOUL OF THE LOTUS

			I
A white lamp,
	hanging -  
In its mouth a pink pearl
			of flame - 
Swinging
	by three strands of light. . . 
A pool	beneath, 
Quaint and secret	as mud. . .

			II
Animate,
Winged for escape 
To the cupped hand of night 
Scooping pink and green stars 
Out of unknown abysses, 
The lotus - 

But there's the stem, hinting, 
Tale-telling of some old connection, 
Some scandal forgotten, 
In the past of the taciturn mud;

Over whose face -  

Or is it a face
Under the mask of cool water? 

The lotus
	looks and fades upward, 
Tirelessly murmuring, 
Politely concealing impatience, 
Like a lady reminding a dolt: 
"Please, you have caught in the door 
A slip of my skirt; 
Let me loose, 
I must go."

CARBON-DIOXIDE

O master Americans,
so supreme over this and all ages
in lawfully bridging the chasm
between any two sums with the process,
indigenous and doubly divine,
of addition, subtraction, multiplication, division - 
I ask you, how is it, 
that the tiddle-diddle-doo breathed into yonder flute
by the trained carbon-dioxide
of yonder wandering tatterdemalion - 
how is it that,
whereas you sanction the barter of
hens for gold, pigs for gold, ducks for gold,
by tossing your clinkety-clink
to the merest squawk-squawk, oint-oint, quack-quack - 
that this tiddle-diddle-doo,
while it dosen't say in words
audible to the ear or legible to the eye - 
'will you drop me a penny for beauty?' - 
how is it, I say,
that that huckster of the flute,
who needs but an addition of oxygen
equal to a subtraction of carbon-dioxide,
lest he fall and beauty fall with him,
is thin as a worm and white as a shell?‚Äî
have you no process for pleasure,
or is pleasure unlawful among you?

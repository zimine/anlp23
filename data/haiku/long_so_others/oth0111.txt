THE CITY IN SUMMER

A dusty vista 
Down which a cat 
Darkly moves. 
Bleak doors 
And bleaker windows; 
A withered vine 
Patters against the wall. 
A newspaper 
Shambling in the gutter; 
A ragged child 
Stands at the corner 
Beside a hungry dog 
Looking in a dust can. 
A murky 
Silence over all: 
The city dead.

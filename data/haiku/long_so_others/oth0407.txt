THE PAINT BOX

When the only color 
On God's palette 
Is gray - 
When he smudges the sky 
With gray -  
And the hills 
And the fields 
And the lawns 
And the hearts of men 
With gray - 
I steal into the play-room 
Of my mind
And take out the paint box
My mother gave me
A million years ago - 
And I smudge
The hills with purple
And the fields with gold,
The lawns with blue
And the hearts of men with crimson - 
There is always someone
Who paints with laughter
When the only color
On God's palette
Is tears.

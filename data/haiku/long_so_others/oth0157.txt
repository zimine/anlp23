SIX SIGNIFICANT LANDSCAPE

			I
An old man sits
In the shadow of a pine tree
In China.
He sees larkspur,
Blue and white,
At the edge of the shadow,
Move in the wind.
His beard moves in the wind.
The pine tree moves in the wind.
Thus water flows
Over weeds.

			II

The night is of the color 
Of a woman's arm: 
Night, the female, 
Obscure,
Fragrant and supple, 
Conceals herself, 
A pool shines, 
Like a bracelet 
Shaken in a dance.

			III
I measure myself
	Against a tall tree. 
I find that I am much taller,
For I reach right up to the sun,
With my eye;
And I reach to the shore of the sea 
With my ear. 
Nevertheless, I dislike 
The way the ants crawl 
In and out of my shadow.

			IV
When my dream was near the moon, 
The white folds of its gown
Filled with yellow light.
The soles of its feet
Grew red.
Its hair rilled
With certain blue crystallizations 
From stars, 
Not far off.

			V

Not all the knives of the lamp-posts.
Nor the chisels of the long streets,
Nor the mallets of the domes 
And high towers,
Can carve
What one star can carve, 
Shining through the grape-leaves.

			VI

Rationalists, wearing square hats,
Think, in square rooms,
Looking at the floor,
Looking at the ceiling.
They confine themselves
To right-angled triangles.
If they tried rhomboids,
Cones, waving lines, ellipses - 
As, for example, the ellipse of the half-moon - 
Rationalists would wear sombreros.

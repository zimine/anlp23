JAGUAR

Nasal intonations of light
And clicking tongues
And publicity of windows
Stoning me with pent-up cries
And smells of abattoirs
And smells of long-dead meat. . .

Some day-end
While the sun is yet cosy as a blanket
Off the warm body of a squaw,
And the jaguars are out to kill - 
With a blue-black night coming on
And a painted cloud
Stalking the first star - 
I shall go alone into the mesa. . .

Into the silence...
The coiled silence. . .
Where a cry can run only a little way
And waver and dwindle and be lost. . .

And there -  where tiny antlers clinch and strain 
As life grapples in a million avid points, 
And moccasins and threshing things 
Strike and die,
Letting their hate live on in the spreading purple
	of a wound -  
I too will make covert of a crevice in the night 
And turn and watch. . .nose at the cleft's edge.

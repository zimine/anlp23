POETRY

Ladislaw the critic
is five feet six inches high
which means
that his eyes
are five feet two inches 
from the ground 
which means
if you read him your poem
and his eyes lift to five feet
and a trifle more than two inches
what you have done
is Poetry - 
should his eyes remain
at five feet two inches
you have perpetrated prose,
and do his eyes stoop
- which heaven forbid! - 
the least trifle below
five feet two inches
you
are an unspeakable adjective.

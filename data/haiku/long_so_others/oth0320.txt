NEW YORK

There is a difference 
wider than a city block
 between the House of Moses 
on Second Avenue
and the Chapel of the Immaculate Virgin 
on Third.

They wait under the same sky, 
on the same level, 
through the same rain -  
honest humans crawl to both -  
but
there is a difference 
wider than a city block 
between the House of Moses 
on Second Avenue
and the Chapel of the Immaculate Virgin 
on Third.

EASTER DAWN

			1.
Dawn at my window . . .
Dawn, a spent runner resting on white stones, 
stones of Grace Church, 
stones of Fifth Avenue,
stones of the arch at Washington Square -  
touching now with a gaunt pallor
	the winged Victory above my bed.

			2.
Shall I too press - how much of my essence? - 
	in a cube of space -  
make pebbles of dreams for the dawn to rest on? 
Shall I break this infinite circle of myself, 
closed yet forever expanding, 
to fling my tall white thought like a lily
	under the running feet of dawns?

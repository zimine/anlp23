VOYAGE A L'INFINI

The swan existing
Is like a song with an accompaniment 
Imaginary.

Across the glassy lake,
Across the lake to the shadow of the willows,
It is accompanied by an image, 
- As by Debussy's
"Reflets dans Peau ".

The swan that is 
Reflects
Upon the solitary water - breast to breast 
With the duplicity:
"The other one!"

And breast to breast it is confused.
O visionary wedding! O stateliness of the procession!
It is accompanied by the image of itself
Alone.

At night
The lake is a wide silence, 
Without imagination.

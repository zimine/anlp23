THE DANDY

He swaggers in green silk and his two coats are 
	lined with fur. Above his velvet shoes his 
	trim, bound ankles twinkle pleasantly.

His nails are of the longest.

Quite the glass of fashion is Mr. Chu!

In one slim hand - the ultimate punctilio - dangles 
	a bamboo cage, wherein a small brown bird 
	sits with a face of perpetual surprise.

Mr. Chu smiles the benevolent smile of one who 
	satisfies both fashion and a tender heart.

Does not a bird need an airing?

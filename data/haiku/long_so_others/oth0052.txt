EXCUSES HIMSELF FOR BEING CONCERNED AT HER GOING.

I've written enough to you, 
about you
and because of you;
and dragged your beauty into too much light.

Now I'll nurse an aching heart 
and with no outlet for the pain 
will crush it under. 
I'll forget you in a while 
remembering you're nothing.
    
When I was young, 
child of the sun, 
imminent with fire 
I did not write of women.
    
But vou have taken the ichor from mv veins. 
You have watered the vitriol of my brain.

WHIMSY

See - with a twirl of fingers
I scatter this tousled drab of a cobweb
Creeping between the jet curls
Of your sleeping, wine-puffed longing.
Yet, he makes but the wraith of a grimace,
As though he spied me in his sleep.
Alas, it will take more than cobweb-snapping
To lift him up again!
But there's a spider hid in his orange doublet, 
Who, some day, will sting his wine-puffed slumber.

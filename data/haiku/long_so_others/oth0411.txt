KISS

Your kiss
Is like the nestling
Of a warming tear
Upon a limpid drooping lash,
The faintest curling of beloved lips
In the launching of a smile,
First blush of maiden's cheek
At thought of being loved,
A whisp of luscious fumed almost nothing
Breathed into a lover's ear.
Yes, 'tis like nothing. Save your kiss.

IN THE NEXT ROOM

And over there
sat a beautiful child,
a child with a beautiful face,
a child with beautiful hands;
but its body was deformed,
its eyes were deeply melancholy.
It smiled from time to time:
its mouth smiled,
but its eyes remained melancholy;
its cheeks smiled,
but its eyes remained melancholy;
its brows smiled,
but its eyes remained melancholy;
mouth, cheeks, brows,
its whole face smiled - 
but its eyes remained unchanged.

In the next room,
they were playing Schubert.

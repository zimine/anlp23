SISTER

Across the meadow 
The breeze is fragrant; 
In a tree a bird 
Disturbs the petals,
But these tombstones are still and cold.

It was a melodious afternoon; 
My sister
With a flying pig-tail 
Chased a dragon-fly 
And laughed over nothing.

Since then twelve years have gone, 
Again the spring has come; 
With tidings and gifts 
I came home
Only to find this cold tombstone.

The chirping of a bird 
Has died away.

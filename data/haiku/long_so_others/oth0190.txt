FIRST MEETING

A softly angular woman gives me quick smiles
Which I grasp at, but never catch.
(They are like the wavering ghosts of glow-worms.)
Her voice is like an empty basket
Lined with the velvet promise of gifts.
I am a child in a cumbersome robe
Curled up in a corner, rebuked.
What must I do to fill the empty basket?

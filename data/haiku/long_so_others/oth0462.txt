VEILS

I shall punish your blindness 
With a veil.

I shall choose words that join
Gaily, word to word,
I shall weave them flauntingly
Into veil upon veil,
I shall wind them defiantly
Over my lips, over my eyes.

You shall not see your name 
On my lips,
You shall not see your image 
In my eyes! 

And through my veils I shall not see 
That you are blind.

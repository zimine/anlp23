Slender cold green cucumbers, 
Tomatoes living red - 
Onions are pearly comets with trails of green.
The wax of beans and yellow of celery fronds,
The bulging pea-pods
Are pleasant to look at,
And the full-curved egg-plant, purple
In corpulent royalty.
The cauliflower is a bride, goes daintily
Beside the cabbages and flounced lettuce balls,
The stiff, prickly foreignness of pineapples.
Asparagus like stacked-up spears and lances,
Parsnips in rustic brown,
Lean pink of carrots, watercress and mint,
And the crooked gnarled horse-raddish roots. . .
Gold-warted squashes, spinach and ragged endive,
And here lie peppers made of green jade.

THEY WHO DANCE

The feet of dancers
Shine with laughter,
Their hearts are vibrant as bells;

The air flows by them 
Divided, like water 
Before a gleaming ship.

Triumphantly their bodies sing, 
Their eyes
Are blind with music.

They move through threatening ghosts, 
Feeling them cool as mist 
Against their brows.

They who dance
Find infinite golden floors
Beneath their feet.

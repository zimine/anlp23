NOVEMBER AFTERNOON

Upon our heads
The oak leaves fall
Like silent benedictions
Closing autumn's gorgeous ritual,
And we,
Upborne by worship,
Lift our eyes to the altar of distant hills.

Beloved,
How can I know 
What gods are yours,
And how divine the visions of your spirit, 
Or hear
The silent prayers your heart has said.

Only by this I feel
Your gods akin to mine‚Äî
That when our lips have met
On this last golden autumn afternoon 
They have confessed
In silence
Our kisses were less precious than our dream

Today,
Our passion drowned in beauty, 
We turn
Our faces toward the hills, 
Where purple haze, like incense, 
Spreads its veil of mystery.

GROTESQUES

			I
Two hundred small boys, 
splashing, wiggling together: 
exceeding disquiet of limbs, 
astounding impression 
of slender octopi, 
frantic.

			II
The Duchess and I regarded you
motionless, by the rhododendron.
She said, "White bodies are too daring;
only brown races should do
that sort of thing."
Said I, "Duchess, that is a marble statue!" 
She looked again through her lorgnette. 
Then, idiot, you whooped, 
and leapt to the fountain.

			III
She shrieks in an agony of mirth,
rolling down the earth lengthwise,
turning over and over.
If they knew this in Richmond,
great and loud would be the outcry;
but the gods and goddesses of far Olympos
do the thing they think of first
and are happy.

			IV
They hang him, and quarter him
His legs they nail over the east gate,
his torso over the north;
and over the west and the south
his head and his arms.
But he derides them more than ever, does Dionysos, 
and they know it.

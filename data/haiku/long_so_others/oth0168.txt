L'ABRE MYSTIQUE

The slender tree
Has leaves that droop like little folds of silk;
Their delicate green
Melts into the blackness of the night.

Passing beneath
I seem to feel soft touches on my cheek 
As though invisible wings
Or the stretching hands of some body-searching spirit 
Brushed past me.

My soul
Disintegrates;
Like a wave driven by the wind 
It bursts. 
Each spark 
Flies up
To find a body in the silent leaves.

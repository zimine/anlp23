OTHERS

Ivory domes . . white wings beating 
	in empty space . .
Nothing doing . . nuts . . bugs . . a regu-
	lar absolute humpty-dumpty busi-
	ness . . pos-i-tive-ly . . falling off 
	walls and no use to call doctor, 
	lawyer, priest . . no use, boy, no use.

O Pal of Mine, O Humpty Dumpty,
	shake hands with me. 
O Ivory Domes, I am one of You:
		Let me in. 
	For God's sake - let me in.

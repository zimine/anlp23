VISTA

The snow,
ah yes, ah yes indeed,
is white and beautiful, white and beautiful, 
verily beautiful -  
from my window. 
The sea,
ah yes, ah yes indeed,
is green and alluring, green and alluring, 
verily alluring -  
from the shore. 
Love,
ah yes, ah yes, ah yes indeed, 
verily yes, ah yes indeed!

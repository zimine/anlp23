THE TEA SHOP

The girl in the tea shop
	is not so beautiful as she was, 
The August has worn against her. 
She does not get up the stairs so eagerly, 
Yes, she also will turn middle-aged, 
And the glow of youth that she spread about us
	as she brought us our muffins 
She will spread about us no longer.
	She also will turn middle-aged.

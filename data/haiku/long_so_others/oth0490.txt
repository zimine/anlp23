THE PRAYER RUG

It is made of silences -  
many colored silken threads -  
the purple of various deaths -  
red gold sacrifice -  
meditation - a delicate green stillness 
melting into blues of ecstacy. 
These are the back ground 
for one thread
that follows the mystic outline 
of a cross - 
and in the centre wreathed 
seven red roses 
seven fires of silence. . . 
To pray
is to stand upon these 
with naked feet 
breast bare to the sun 
and to sing.

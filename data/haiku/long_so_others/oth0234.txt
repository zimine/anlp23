THE HIGHEST BIDDER

	To the highest bidder, 
Your birthplace, Walt Whitman, 
Under the hammer. . . .
The old farm on Paumanok north of Huntington, 
Its trees,
Its leaves of grass!

	Voices bid and counterbid over those ninety 
		acres. . .
And your own voice among them, like an element, 
Roaring and outbidding.

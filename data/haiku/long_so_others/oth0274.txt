CERTAIN MEN

			I
His last spirit-child has walked away -  
The mist-basket it slept in, swings empty.
 But his eyes are many fire-hoops 
Rolled by other spirit-children 
Trooping into him.

			II
Within a long-forgotten grave 
The crumbled body of his first grief lies. 
Yet sometimes its slowly striding ghost 
Crosses his face.

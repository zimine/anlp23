			I
You love
As the wind loves a bed of blue larkspur, 
But I
As a yellow poppy
Loves starlight in the pool.
     
			II
Since I smile when you offer me
	Pearls and roses 
You never guess my hunger for
	Circlets of moonstone,
     	Jade anklets,
     	Chrysoprase, jacinth, and amaranth,
     	Flag-flowers,
     	Saffron,
     	And the bitter brown blossoms 
		Of the calycanthus.
     
			III
My life is a smooth green vase 
To hold the purple thistles 
Of your passion.
     
			IV
You who hear only the words 
That say I love you 
Know of my love
What a tree dashed with white foam 
Knows of salt bitterness of the sea.
     
			V
	No, I do not love you. 
A hundred times I have choked my love of you, 
	And left it dead a hundred times.

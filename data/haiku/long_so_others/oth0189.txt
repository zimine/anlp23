JUST AFTER MIDDLE AGE

Through a window broken by its white leap,
Snow has tumbled into a small room.
It twists about the huge fallen black candles;
It licks the red feet of the tall, silk-stilfed altar;
It slowly rises till it grazes the arched, bare feet
Of a dancer, stiffened in her highest whirl.

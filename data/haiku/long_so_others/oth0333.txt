NIGHT

	I opened the door 
And night stared at me like a fool, 
Heavy dull night, clouded and safe -  
I turned again toward the uncertainties 
Of life within doors.

	Once night was a lion, 
No, years ago night was a python 
Weaving designs against space 
With undulations of his being -  
Night was a siren once.

	Oh sodden middle-aged night, 
I hate you!

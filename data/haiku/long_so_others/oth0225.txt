THE DAUGHTER

She had harbored heaped grudges 
(But deep, for the hid money's sake) 
Many years. 
And now the body
Dried, and sore, continually bedridden, 
Lies at last in the coffin:
And the cat
(Ever loathsome to the deceased) 
Creeps in there and sleeps,
Sleeps curled by the stockinged feet with long nails. 
The daughter discovering this, to her distraught 
	mind
Retaliation seems possible,
And very quickly
Drives in the screws,
Working swiftly -  
When finished, laughing.

All night
The yowling of the cat, 
The spotted cat, 
Continues,
And the unrest of all carrion 
As also the laughter.

At intervals
The cat's efforts for escape
Are renewed, becoming feebler, 
So the laughter.

But when the neighbors -  
Coming to nail up the box 
And assisting, interfere -  
Arrive (long after dawn) 
All but the unrest of all carrion 
Has ceased.

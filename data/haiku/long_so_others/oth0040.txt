"HI, HI, HI. . . " - VERLAINE

	To young men, who, being loved, therefrom engender 
within them a true passion, enduring nobly its heats 
and its chills and the vagaries of mistresses under the 
phases of the moon.
	Who, seeing each new incident with the most intimate 
and disillusioning psychology, yet remain silent; and 
having suffered with what noble forbearance, learn they 
are reviled therefor.
	Gentlemen, The Dutch Dolls!

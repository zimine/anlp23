HERM-APHRODITE-US

Behold me!
The perfect one!
Epitome of the universe!
The crystal sphere, - 
reflecting
sex, - 
being, - 
God.

For long ages, - 
moonlike, - 
I turned one hemisphere
away from God, - 
stubbornly reflecting
only half of His perfection, - 
Man.

For this sin
God mocked me, - 
showing himself in me;
monster of masculinity, - 
tyrannous,
cruel,
war-mad, 
death-gluttonous, 
God, - inverted.

Then through love, 
God saved me, -  
melted my perverseness, 
set me spinning, 
in full God-light, -  
reflecting wholly 
His perfection, 
woman in man, 
man in woman, -  
herm-aphrodite-us.

Behold me! 
The perfect one! 
The crystal sphere, -  
reflecting perfect sex, - 
reflecting perfect being, -  
reflecting God.

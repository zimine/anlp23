BARE

This veil
Of lavender and dawn
Floats off
Invisible,
And this of purple noon 
Unwinds in wisdom, 
And this of evening 
Twitters, undulates, 
Dips, darts, 
And this of night 
Circles around me singing
To the very edge and presence of the crescent moon -  
And brushes the tip
Like lips 
Three times.

PEAR TREE

Silver dust
lifted from the earth, 
higher than my arms reach, 
you have mounted, 
O silver,
higher than my arms reach 
you front us with great mass;
     
no flower ever opened 
so staunch a white leaf, 
no flower ever parted silver 
from such rare silver;
     
O white pear,
your flower-tufts
thick on the branch
bring summer and ripe fruits
in their purple hearts.

STONES

It is best now
to give suffering its way with me,
like a sea with a stone,
and let the spray which is others' joy - 
the spray dancing on those
I bumped against
while bounding and tumbling and rolling here -  
give me content.

Suffering
carves smoothness
which cannot cut any longer - 
should I roll again.

LITTLE FOLK

Of late,
I've been craving a child,
the adoption of a child.
Not a child of mine - 
I have so little blood for that,
and that requires two - 
but an ordinary child,
like myself,
who will be serious with me,
playfully,
and play with me,
seriously - 
I have quarts of blood for that.
Little One:
Will you adopt me?

THE PRAIRIE

Before me the great dark broad-breasted prairie expands,
Bared to the pale moon's quiet light,
A few trees rustle gently, steadily, insistently.
Weary I sink upon the great broad breast.
On every side the mist arises - 
A huge strange figure with pale shifting garments and 
	cool white arms that close on me more and more -  
Till the turbid fever cools,
And all the wild desires are lulled at last to languid 
	rest.

IN THE TUBE

The electric car jerks;
I stumble on the slats of the floor,
Fall into a leather seat
And look up.

A row of advertisements, 
A row of windows,
Set in brown woodwork pitted with brass nails,
A row of hard faces,
Immobile,
In the swaying train,
Rush across the flickering background of fluted dingy 
					tunnel;
A row of eyes,
Eyes of greed, of pitiful blankness, of plethoric com-
					placency,
Immobile,
Gaze, stare at one point, 
At my eyes.

Antagonism, 
Disgust,
Immediate antipathy,
Cut my brain, as a sharp dry reed
Cuts a finger.
I surprise the same thought I
n the brasslike eyes:

"What right have you to live?"

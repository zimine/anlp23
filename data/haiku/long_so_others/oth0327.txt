OPUS 371

	The tawny plexus, the animate focus, of infinite 
		luminous rays, 
Moving across the street 
In the golden nimbus of light -  
Reflecting, refracting, identifying 
The flooding waves of ether: 
It is an irony of the curled smiling Gods 
That light, leaving the sun, 
Should travel a hundred million miles 
In adventure of desolate space, lonely and perilous, 
To splinter and disintegrate at last 
Against a street-cur.

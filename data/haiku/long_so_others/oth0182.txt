TO A MAN

The once white statue of a woman, smudged and bloodied
With the dirty fingers of years, was his mind.
It lay, grave and neglected, at the base of its tall 
	pedestal . . .
But one day I found him washing it with his soul.
And heaving it with the strength of a smile, to the top
	of the pedestal.

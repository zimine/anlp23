THE SENSATION OF A SMELL

Oh the wise faces I have carried to my lips like
	treacherous wines. 
The simple women I have seated on my knees like
    	branches of flowers.
    
And above all one, with brown hair, who resembled 
	a flower
and who left in my life the vague sensation of a 
	smell.
    
Her diamond eyes had the disquieting look of non-
	existence
and she gave me the strongest sensation of death I
    	have had of a woman 
and the most burning sense of life that I have been
    	able to obtain.

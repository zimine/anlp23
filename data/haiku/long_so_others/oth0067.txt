CINEMA EXIT

After the click and whirr
Of the glimmering pictures,
The dry feeling in the eves
As the sight follows the electric flickerings,
The banal sentimentality of the films,
The hushed concentration of the people,
The tinkling piano - 
Suddenly
A vast avalanche of greenish yellow light
Pours over the threshold;
White globes darting vertical rays
Spot the sombre buildings;
The violent gloom of the night
Battles with the radiance;
Swift figures, legs, skirts, white cheeks, hats
Flicker in oblique rays of dark and light.

Millions of human vermin 
Swarm sweating
Along the night-arched cavernous roads. 
(Happily rapid chemical processes 
Will disintegrate them all.)

SCALES

As I was dusting a long unopened book, 
Two tiny oval scales 
Went fluttering to the floor 
Like a small brown moth. . . . 
Dead leaves like living wings -  
But the might of them!

They have lifted me over the seas, 
And from March to September!
They have carried me from wind-buffeted Bermuda 
To the breathless slopes of Canandaigua, 
Violet-green with hop-fields.

Once more I hear the singing of the hobos, 
The wandering hop-pickers; 
Of the village girls
In checked ginghams and poke bonnets;
And the swish and rustle of the vines
As the pole-pullers swing them to the bins.
Once more I smell the bitter-sweet
Of the yellow-green tasselly cones;
And my fingers burn and grow black
From stripping the scales from the stems.

I am walking home,
Plodding along moodily
At the foot of orderly vineyards
Half cleared of grapes. . . .
Concords, Wordens, Niagaras,
Pink Delawares, ruddy Catawbas,
And Agawams like maroon marbles.

Below, meadows purple with alfalfa: 
And through a cloud 
Of little white butterflies 
Floating over one,
I see the slumbering sapphire of the lake -  
Which made me dream of Bermuda!

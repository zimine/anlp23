AN OLD NEGRO ASLEEP

As spilled, dried wine that colors earth,
The yellow-white light sinks into his rubbed brown face,
And perhaps reaches even the seeded dreams below,
Melting them to webbed shapes he cannot hold.
Happily so, for if he awoke still bearing them,
He would be a filled chest unable to open itself. . . 
He squats afterward, making white grinning trinkets,
And thinks them the dreams he had.

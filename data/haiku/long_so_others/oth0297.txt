DANSE RUSSE

If I when my wife is sleeping 
and the baby and Kathleen 
are sleeping
and the sun is a flame-white disc
in silken mists
above shining trees,
if I in my north room
dance naked, grotesquely,
before my mirror,
waving my shirt around my head
and singing softly to myself:
"I am lonely, lonely.
I was born to be lonely. 
I am best so!"
If I admire my arms, my face, 
my shoulders, flanks, buttocks,
against the yellow drawn shades, -  
who shall say I am not 
the happy genius of my household?

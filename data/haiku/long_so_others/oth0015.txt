THE OGRE

Sweet child,
Little girl with well shaped legs
You cannot touch the thoughts
I put over and under and around you.
This is fortunate for they would
Burn you to an ash otherwise.
Your petals would be quite curled up.
        
But this is all beyond you - no doubt.
Yet you do feel the brushings 
Of the fine needles:
The tentative lines of your whole body
Prove it to me:
So does your fear of me,
Your shyness:
Likewise the toy baby cart
That you are pushing - 
And besides, mother has begun
To dress your hair in a knot.
These are my excuses.

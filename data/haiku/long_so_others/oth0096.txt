ELUSION

I dive from height, 
And swim
Out through a clinging sea,

Far in, I see a monstrous god. . . 
Stone upon stone of agony 
Piled
Calmly to heaven. 

I heard it cry:
"Make an image to fill them with fear. 
In love there is no awe; 
They must tremble."

We have made the image. . . . 
It advances flaming upon me. 
I drown in brass. . . 
I sink
Crushed beneath all weight.

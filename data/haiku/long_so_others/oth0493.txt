STEEL TOWN

		Gray 
		as with time 
		and austere
		as the colonnades of a ruined temple
		stand the steel-mill chimneys
		at sundown.
		Curved
		knotted
		stems of fleurs de lys
		rise the gray smoke columns
		to blossom in blackening mist,

While the trams course along the dull streets 
Flashing at intervals with bill-boards, 
While sooty Jews sell second-hand furniture 
And ladies go on buying laces, 
Till the little shop-girls flitter home 
Shivering under their cat-furs.

		Then 
		red
		as Aurora, 
		unchanging, 
		glow the furnaces 
		all night,
		and the clouds are like meadows of popples 
		the wind waves over and flickers:

	Trip hammers thud 
	in regular fall
	streams of white iron flow surely, 
While the good folk sleep in their beds, 
And the young folk kiss between dances, 
While newsies doze on cold doorways, 
Till the cinema screens cease to flicker, 
Till milkmen scuff on back porches.

		Then 
		gray
		as with time 
		and austere
		as the colonnades of a ruined temple
		stand the steel-mill chimneys
		at sunrise,
		and curved
		like pale
		stems of iris
		rise the smoke-columns
		to blossom
		in soot-dripping
		mist.

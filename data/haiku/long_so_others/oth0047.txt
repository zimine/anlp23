THE PLOT THICKENS.

I laid upon my love
the spell of the kiss,
and left her to her bitter pain.
    
Outside was Carnival.    
When I returned 
she was gone. 
The night was cold 
but I slept warm, 
for I said
she sleeps more cold than I.
    
That my love should leave me 
hurts me nothing; 
But that the spell of my kiss 
might thus easily be broken, 
I am ashamed.

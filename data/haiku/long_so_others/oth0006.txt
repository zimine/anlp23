THE IDIOT

- Yes!
But as for me
I pass without debate of life and death, 
Stumbling or dancing as the tune is pitched. 
Not choosing, not remembering; 
Dragging no chains and aiming for no star. 
I know who frowns and grudges: 
'Concentrate essence of inconstant moments,
The flower's soul, the fool's way his!' 
And that may be. 
But ever I peer about
Observing these anxious fretful folk, these moderns, 
Tired Atlases who bear
A world of borrowed marble and stolen fame, -  
I peer about, and ever as I pass
Touch softly each gleaming pillar, each smoking shrine
And unperceived, drop tears upon them.
Tears.
For men are sleepers in a world of dream,
An unreal, staggering world,
That any moment, as I know,
Will break asunder, crashing, heaved apart
By bursting seeds of God's compelling spring,
Temple on temple, arch on arch
All staggering down and whelmed
In waters of eager thought, in flames of love;
Against which day I neither lock nor loose
Nor own nor will be owned within this doom
That with a few others undetached and free
My soul may cry:
'Lo God within this quickened earth
Plow under this yearning heart which I have borne
So many seasons, unfertile till you had sown.'
- - - - Aye,
The fool's way mine.
		Where is that Prophet crying within my heart?

TO A PREGNANT WOMAN

This is possession! 
To own so surely, so completely; 
So absolutely to command, 
To serve, to keep.
Knowing you hold the beating life of the beloved
In the depths of your life;
Breathing through your breath,
Enfolded in your strength for its sustainment
     
"I am my beloved's
And he is mine"
You cried once to your lover:
But who is able to own another.
Or be owned by another?
Only now may love truly possess:
The beloved is yours.

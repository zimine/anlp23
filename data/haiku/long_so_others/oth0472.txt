THE BARBER

	I wield the razor, sling hot towels and talk.
	My daily newspaper is the racing chart and my pas-
time making bets on fleet-footed horses.
	Whatever is left from betting I divide with my wife 
and a yellow woman who lives in an apartment on Wa-
bash Avenue.
	(Poor Wife! She gets very little.)
	I love gay clothes, a good supply of Fatimas and the 
fire in gin and whiskey.
	I love life. Who doesn't?

VIE DE BORDEAUX GRANDEE OF SPAIN

I never knew anyone else so well who did not tutoyer 
	me.
In the moment of the chief pain
You held the distance of the plural
Between our spirits,
Though and when
You inquired solicitously
Of my apparent suffering.

If now you were to tutoyer me
I think for me you would lose something precious,
Like a castle visited.
Lazy and obvious
Is the singular - 
An intrigue in the shadow of a wall at night. 
After which
You separate without knowing the color of each other's 
	hair.

Grandee of Spain -  
Not yet,
And I am content.

POEMS FOR DANCING

			I
It is a cold, grey morning,
and the wind scarcely moves,
and the sun cannot pierce through its covering
of grey. . . . .
The wind wakes up,
the trees begin to sway,
and the paper in the street below
is blown in a circle. . . . .
then. . right away. . . . .
    
			II
Oh! moon,
pale thing that shines at night,
and casts the long shadows
of the trees
towards me.
They seem to grope
like long, black, tapering arms,
when they are moved by the wind.

Oh! wind,
the cooling rush of air, 
that fans my hair, 
when you are rough 
I love you.
    
To be on a hill, 
with the moon and the wind, 
the smell of grass and trees, 
to dabble with the cool dew.
Moon. . . . . . .
wind. . . . .
trees, dew,
grass. . . and you.

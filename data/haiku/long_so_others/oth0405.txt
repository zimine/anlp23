THE UNQUIET

He thought to solve
The unquiet of his heart,     
In the stillness of solitude;
But the ticking of the clock,
Penetrated the silence;
Then song-sparrows sang
In the evergreens at his window;
And there came the ache
Of a heavily loaded wagon
Straining
Up the hill;
And the voices of things in his room 
Clamored,
Till he sought the noise of the city 
For its silence.

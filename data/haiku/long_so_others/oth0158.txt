INSCRIPTION FOR A MONUMENT

To the imagined lives
Evoked by music,
Creatures of horns, flutes, drums, 
Violins, bassoons, cymbals - 
Nude porters that glistened in Burma
Defiling from sight;
Island philosophers spent
By long thought beside fountains; 
Big-bellied ogres curled up in the sunlight, 
Stuttering dreams. . .

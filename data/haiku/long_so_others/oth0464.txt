MUD

I am dazed and weary 
From the shapelessness 
Of what I am - 

I am poured
Among haphazard stones 
In meaningless patterns.

Yesterday's sun dried me 
Between rounded cobbles, 
To-day's deluge sweeps me 
Toward alien pavements, 
To-morrow's sun shall dry me 
In a new design.

Better the turbid gutter 
Toward the open sea!

COLLECTORS


The barnacle of crowds -  
Like a tuck
On a finished skirt, unnoticed - 
He collected his material
Covertly:
A ragpicker,
A scavenger of words.

And the gleanings 
Of his hearing 
He would costume 
In his own words, 
And parade before 
A listener.

So that now,
Across the tea-cup,
He was telling
Of his research,
Of his study,
Of his deep thought-out
Conclusions.

And the lady,
Connoisseur of old thoughts 
Bound in new gilt bindings, 
Smiled approval 
At the finding 
Of another curio 
To place
In her long gallery.

THE COMPASSIONATE PILGRIM.

I laughed,
chatted gaily;
was most attentive
to the foil I'd brought to pique you.
You'd no notion.
    
And though you laughed, 
I saw through it 
and was not hurt.
    
After,
you stood silent, lone 
most pitiful.
    
All this trouble
because I could not kiss you
in the crowded room.

You wanted to keep me
But they'd not let you,
and you gave way.
Now I'm gone
and you're a memory.
Silent, lone,
most pitiful.

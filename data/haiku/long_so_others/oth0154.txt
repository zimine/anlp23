TATTOO

The light is like a spider.
It crawls over the water.
It crawls over the edges of the snow.
It crawls under your eyelids
And spreads its webs there - 
Its two webs.

The webs of your eyes 
Are fastened
To the fiesh and bones of you 
As to rafters or grass.

There are filaments of your eyes 
On the surface of the water 
And in the edges of the snow.

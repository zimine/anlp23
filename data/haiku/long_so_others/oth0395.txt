			I
The moon is a girl 
Riding a white pony 
Over the gray sagebrush 
Of the sky;
The stars are frightened white rabbits 
That run across the path in front of her.
    
			II
The moon is a silver fish; 
The tall pine has caught it 
In the net of its flung branches 
And stands watching its struggles
And waiting: for it to die.
    
			III
The clouds are sea-gulls 
Flying over the ocean of the sky; 
The moon is a lighthouse, 
And the white-bodied clouds 
Beat their gray wings against it.
    
			IV
From one of the branches 
Of the magnolia tree 
In our garden
It is large and creamy and fragrant; 
It is the first flower of the year.
    
The other buds are angry 
Because it has opened first.
    
Buds, do not be angry! 
For it will wither 
And fall
Before the morning -

KALEIDESCOPICS 

Gondolas with white freightage 
Passed,
And muted barcaroles 
Destroyed old houses.

The iridescent plush rope sways
With the rhythm
Of an old canzone of Genoa.

He died.
Let us dance elegant fandangos 
In blues and golds, 
And consort
With blinder things than parchment bats
To gather dripping garlands
Of mottled toadstools
To show the hate we loved him with.

Weave together delicate preludes 
And stitch in faint cords 
Of simple colors 
Like gray,
But let us not be betrayed 
Beyond beginnings.

The hunchbacked windmill 
Grunts,
And the crows caw and creak 
Like old leather
And buffet the twisted gnarled darkness 
Hour on hour.

Trinn! Trinn!
Do you hear it?
Like a crystal ball
Split into diamonds
And flung like hail-stones
Against tarnished spears:
Trinn! Trinn!

Fourteen queens: 
Seven in gold, 
Five in green, 
And two
Are covered each 
With an old-rose 
Silk sari
Dotted with vermilion discs 
And fringed with dusty gold. 
My knees
Crack together when I would go 
To one or to the other 
Like the fray of slave oars 
When two old Asian galleys 
Clashed.

Twelve years
Through the mandarin's red coat
I pursued
The white thistle,
And bit at swaying ends
Of snapped gold threads.

Four jaundiced ghouls 
Hide in your gray lips 
Where the red plum-tree 
Is bent
In a haggard arch.

TALKS

Like a scattering of golden mice
Came your words.
And my words were drifts of rice
Flung to them. . . . 
And the evening of whispering laughs, 
The evening we made soft rose coats for each other 
And put them on. 
The one I gave had many buttons - 
The wraiths of old, delicate loves. 
And yours was threaded with little grey question-
	patterns.

I cannot remember the mornings we had. 
Perhaps we sat with closed eyes 
And made a great beaten-silver cup
 From which we never drank.

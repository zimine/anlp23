SYLVANETTES

		Rain on the Lake
To-day
The lake is a disillusioned mirror -
Weeping - 
Because its mistress has grown old. . . .

		Rain on the Lake
Little pearl fire-flies 
Pirouetting -  
In sparkling pizzicatos -  
On blue glass. . . .

	Over the Lake a Birch-Tree Bendin
Little birch-tree
With your nude body
Your white, melodious body - 
You are a young girl
Combing your hair in the glass,
Awaiting your first beloved. . . .

In the Birch-Trees the Swallows Playing 
	Swallows
     	You are silver songs
     	Chasing each other
     	And playing tag - 
     	Swallows
     	You are the songs
     	I make for my beloved
     	They too, play tag
     	In the birch-tree of her heart. . . .
     
	Across the Moon a Thin Veil 
Moon
You are a woman 
Draped in black 
Pale and beautiful -  
Mourning the little birds 
That sang
Through the windows 
Facing the dawn
While you fed them the silver crumbs 
	of your youth. . . .

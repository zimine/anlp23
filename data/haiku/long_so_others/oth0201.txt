WEDDED TO A SHREW

Midsummer sultriness, 
Distant rumblings 
Among low half-hills 
Of Reason. . . .

The fine white linen
Of your courage wilts. . . .

Simultaneous with a blinding flash 
Comes the downpour -  
You cannot escape 
Its sharp pelting hail.

"Good day to you!" 
A voice behind -  
Your neighbor!

Hastily you wrap a 
Smooth white cloak 
Of blandness about you 
To hide the shrinking 
Drenched lines
Of your outraged composure.

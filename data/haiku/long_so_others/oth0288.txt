LOVE SONG

Daisies are broken
petals are news of the day
stems lift to the grass tops
they catch on shoes
part in the middle
leave root and leaves secure.

Black branches 
carry square leaves 
to the wood's top. 
They hold firm
break with a roar 
show the white!

Your moods are slow 
the shedding of leaves 
and sure
the return in May! 

We walked
in your father's grove 
and saw the great oaks 
lying with roots 
ripped from the ground.

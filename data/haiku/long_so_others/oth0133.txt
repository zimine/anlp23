EARTH WISDOM

Said the earth:
I love you, flower.
Go up and see the sun.
And feel the rain - it's soft.
Winds will play with you,
merry winds.
But see that great blue - 
I like that round blue - 
I want that high blue - 

Said the earth: 
I love you, flower. 
It is late. 
Come back to me. 
I don't want to -  
I wont - 
I want the moon -  
I want - 

You've been playing too long, flower. 
That isn't good for you. 
Nor fair to the morrow.
Come,
said the earth

OPUS 106

This, in impatience,
Is a spectrum of Howard Fribley.

Have you ever seen a fly pounce like a lion? 
I have.
And I have seen the little legs of Professor Fribley's 
	mind

Slily approach what seemed an idea 
And pounce on it through his spectacles.

And I have heard the cords in his neck
Lower him into the grave, 
Creaking.

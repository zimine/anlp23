MIDNIGHT CAPRICE

Prisoner there,
I would bring you - 
what is it? - 
what shall I call it? - 
no, midnight between us,
scarce any feeling can find you.
Ah, I have a light in me - 
where is the light in me? - 
and you have a light in you - 
haven't you a light in you? - 
but the corridor -
where is the corridor? -
however I call or you yearn,
is there a corridor?
I could sneak you a thought -
would the gaoler see a thought? -
which might reach-what is it? -
the chink in you?
Even so -
what thought has a body, 
knees, arms, hands, a mouth? -
has thought a body, can thought touch thought? -
nor can I find the chink in me -
have I a chink in me?
Prisoner there,
sing you to yourself,
sing I to myself -
this be our courtship!
Nay, I came from the cell
of a woman once -
she had a light in her - 
she had a corridor -
she sneaked me out to me - w
as the gaoler away? 
Even so -
what body has a thought
to remember that? -
or how it was done? -
and how to do it again? -
were I mother to myself,
could I do it? -
ah, were I mother to myself,
and you father to yourself -
is that our corridor?
Prisoner there - look -
can you see from where you are? -
have you a sorrow? -
is that your sorrow,
silver hood and silver cloak,
dainty hands and dainty feet,
dancing a slow step with mine? -
what a happy movement now! -
one can fairly hear a gigue!
Or has that fop of a moon -
come through a flimsy cloud -
like a rider through a hoop -
for another caprice with the stars? -
foppery courts frippery?
Even so,
cannot ever sorrows meet?

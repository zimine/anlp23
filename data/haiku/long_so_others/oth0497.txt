VISION

You have yet to attain
	contemplation of a person 
without intervention of your own - 
	and so,
you have not beheld your own.

You hold the glass,
	face to you, back to him -  
not having felt
	the earth hold its sea
	sky-ward,
	the sky hold its sun 
	earth-ward.

It needs
	but a twist of reflection
	to bring recognition around -  
but that needs
	the Titan-wrist
	pulse of the earthquake
	and pulse of the meteor 
of heredity 
and humility,
	whose child is
	self-annihilation.

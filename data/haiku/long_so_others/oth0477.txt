SWALLOWS

The Blueblack swallows with their saffron breasts 
Punctuate the rooftree - and they make pretty commas 
On the wires,
And place superb accents above the blowing corn - 
How would it be to skim like them,
The surface of all things,
To graze the cheek of every beauty,
And press one's lips to the sky, with a sudden frenzy - 
To dot the pale vowels on the pages of the sun
With swift points of beetle-blue;
They turn their breasts up to the sky
Swinging arrow-like, upon a skipping wind,
These countless commas with painted wings.

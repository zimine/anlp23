MORTALITY

The milk of desire is dried in me. 
When passion wails with querulous hunger 
I may not bare my breast to give him suck. 
Instead,
With patient eyes
Upon the clock of duty
I feed him broth
Or prepared milk,
Artificially heated
To a certain tepid temperature.
He lingers in frail life.
I still his cries.
I soothe his pain
And hope for miracles
Not daring to see or mourn
The wasted limbs,
The uneasy breath,
The brow already dark 
With mystery
And death.

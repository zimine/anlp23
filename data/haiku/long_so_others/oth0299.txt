GOOD-NIGHT

In brilliant gas-light 
I turn the kitchen spigot 
and watch the water plash 
into the clean white sink. 
On the grooved drain-board 
to one side is
a glass filled with parsley -  
crisped green.
		Waiting
for the water to freshen
I glance at the spotless floor, - 
a pair of rubber sandals
lie side by side
under the wall-table,
all is in order for the night.

Waiting, with a glass in my hand, - 
three girls in crimson satin
pass close before me on
the murmurous background of
the crowded opera - 
			it is
memory playing the clown -  
three vague, meaningless girls 
full of smells and 
the rustling sound of 
cloth rubbing on cloth and 
little slippers on carpet -  
high-school French 
spoken in a loud voice!

Parsley in a glass,
still and shining,
brings me back. I take my drink
and yawn deliciously.

I am ready for bed.

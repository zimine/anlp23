PRISON WEEDS

The isles of evil odors
a chain of islands
on the river
like ulcers
on the flesh
the isles of evil odors.

I break stones 
in the stone shed
big ones 
into little ones 
big ones
into little ones
big ones
into little ones
big ones
into little ones
I break stones
in the stone shed.

A row of men
a row of naked men
standing against the wall 
waiting, 
a desk, 
a scribe, 
a centurion, 
they are recording 
marks of identification: 
"deep long scar on right side" 
"one on palm of right hand" 
"one on back of right hand" 
"one on palm of left hand" 
"one on back of left hand" 
"one on instep of right foot" 
"one on sole of right foot" 
"one on instep of left foot" 
"one on sole of left foot" 
"next"

Bones
a barrel of bones
the bones of last week's stew
the rotten prison stew
no - 
it's not a dog 
it's not a cat 
it's a man 
a man
made in the image of God.

I bought twenty-five onions 
from a nigger 
twenty-five onions 
for ten cents 
every night
before the lights go out 
we each eat an onion
weeping
we each eat an onion.

Old men
a line of old men
like so many patriarchs
or fathers of the church
they are the bucket gang
they carry the buckets to the river
in solemn procession
like so many patriarchs
or fathers of the church
they carry the buckets to the river
with heads bowed
with trembling hands
they carry the buckets to the river.

He never speaks 
he never reads 
he never laughs 
always silent 
always brooding
always sad 
deep sunken eyes 
black beard
noble brow
he resembles a German Christ 
no one knows why "he's up" 
no one knows when he came 
no one knows when he'll go 
they say 
"nobody home".

"The Priest"
"Who wants the priest?"
the keeper calls
"I want the priest''
"Well my son?"
"Father!"
"What my son?"
"Father!"
"the Christ is in the cooler" 
The priest passed on 
he did not understand.

Early
in the morning
I look out on the river
the little barred window
faces the river
I like to watch
the life on the river
tugs
scows
sail boats
and steamships
I watch them gliding
along on the river
some up
some down
some fast
some slow
some noisy
some silent
I watch them gliding
along the river
I like to look
at the life on the river
Late at night
I look out on the river
the little barred window
faces the river.

The warden
he's a nice old man
in uniform
so spic and span
his face is red
his hair is white
his eyes are blue
his smile is bright
his home is swell
his table fine
and I'm quite sure
so is his wine
investigators
go away
with nothing
but the best
to say
they're satisfied 
beyond expression 
the warden
made such good impression.

Now
that I'm soon to be free 
another day 
another night 
now
that I'm soon to be free 
I feel
a strange unease 
Maybe the 
soul
just before
the expiration of its sentence
on the verge of regaining 
the freedom of eternal life 
feels
at the thought of separation 
from the body 
as I feel
at the thought of separation 
from my cell.

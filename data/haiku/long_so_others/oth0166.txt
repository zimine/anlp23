ADAM'S SONG, AND MINE

You pass me merrily.
Your hair dashes back like the spray under a racing
	bowsprit. 
Your eyes are alight. 
You beckon me. 
You dare to beckon me 
Because you do not understand 
The baby rabbits at your feet. 
Virgin!

You do not understand my quivering. 
Your legs are bare. I am ashamed !

Yes,
I am coming.
I am coming to scramble with you
Through the angry bushes.
I shall race with you over the wet sand,
And I shall bear with your innocence
Until
You feel how warm my breath is, -  
Virgin!

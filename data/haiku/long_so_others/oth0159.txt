BOWL

For what emperor
Was this bowl of Earth designed?
	Here are more things
	Than on any bowl of the Sungs,
	Even the rarest - 
	Vines that take
	The various obscurities of the moon, 
	Approaching rain
	And leaves that would be loose upon the wind,
	Pears on pointed trees,
	The dresses of women, 
	Oxen. . .
	I never tire
	To think of this.

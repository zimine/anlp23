HAZEL DEAN

She is beautiful in her prudicity 
Which is persuasive in its sweetness, 
And appeals to the finer sensibilities 
Of men.

The bloom of her youth is also beautiful.
The cleverness of her repartee is felicitous.
Her love is beautiful.
She is conscious of her love
And the philter of her eyes.

Alas, her beauty will not endure, 
Except her intrinsic goodness 
Which is her soul's beauty.

Her woman's intuition
Has taught her some things,
And her heart;
But she has no capacity for books, 
She is nescient of the ponderance of life 
And a help-mate's philosophy of life 
Which are the lasting beauties of life; 
For anility disputes somatic charms.

When I have tired with my lucubrations
And taxed with the lore of books
And the gravity of the universe,
The lightness of her heart and downy talk,
The freshness of her na√Øve self
Offer me a diversion of thought.

Sometimes I talk with her about her lovers
Who are near the age of her;
For I am older than she is.
This gives me the advantage
Of a more extended lover's past,
With a tentation of romance
Which she delights to hear related,
Because, trusting to chance and her girlhood
Has denied her
Extensive, tentative romance.

Her inscient heart knows I love her,
But rather as a filigree gill
(I have loved her hand tactually)
And she has also discerned
That the love-world of ours
Is a dream-world,
Being too frail and small
To hold the future with its realities.

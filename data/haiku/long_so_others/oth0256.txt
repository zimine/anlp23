HINDU LOVE CHANTS

There is a silver web called silence; 
It hangs between us, soft and blinding; 
Break it, my love, and let me hear your voice; 
But break it only with a sound as beautiful.
     
I feel your breath upon my heart; 
I know, through seven lakes and mountains, that you 
	smile:
I need no words to say you love me; 
If your love went from me, the truth would fall upon 
	my heart and crush it.

THE PROBLEM IS

The problem is - 
but I forgot - there is no problem.
I have only to put my sea
into a bottle of thin green glass
simple of form, as you suggest;
and to enclose my sky
in a carven case of pure ivory.
The test will be
when these stand upon your writing-table.
Will my sea fill the room
with its salt and its singing,
with wine, with vigor and movement?
Will my sky escape
lean over and give
her suns and moons
and the lightning of her silence
and manna of rest
 and musical sleep?

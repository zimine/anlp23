EARTHY ANECDOTES

Every time the bucks went clattering 
Over Oklahoma
A firecat bristled in the way.

Wherever they went,
They went clattering,
Until they swerved,
In a swift, circular line,
To the right,
Because of the firecat.

Or until they swerved, 
In a swift, circular line, 
To the left, 
Because of the firecat.

The bucks clattered. 
The firecat went leaping, 
To the right, to the left, 
And
Bristled in the way.

Later, the firecat closed his bright eyes 
And slept.

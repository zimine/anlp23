IN THE PARK

Stout woman in shades of red
And twisted-shouldered girl in a lemon-colored jacket,
Your lowered heads are slanting cups
From which fluid smiles splash upon my dry face. . . 
And in payment, let me trip beside you, pushing your
	flat baby-cart
And singing you songs of the simple trees on the way.

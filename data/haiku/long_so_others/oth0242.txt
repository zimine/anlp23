MY LIFE IS A MEMORY

When I met her I loved myself. 
It was she who had my best singing, 
she who set flame to my obscure youth, 
she who raised my eyes toward heaven.
    
Her love moistened me, it was an essence.
I folded my heart like a handkerchief
and after I turned the key on my existence.
    
And thus it perfumes my soul 
with a distant and subtle .

THE ENDS JUSTIFY THE MEANS

At the Pest House dance
The undertaker and a midwife
Were sitting out a hesitation,
And this is what he said to her:
"Poets say that Birth and Death
Are the two great sacraments of life.
You are priestess of the one
And I high-priest of the other.
We minister at the awful altars,
We open the gates of joy and woe,
We tune the carol and the dirge,
And for all this we are outcasts,
Despised and rejected of men.
They praise the song and loathe the singer.
But isn't this pest house delightful?
Dansons! dansons!"

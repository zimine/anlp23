GRAY ROOM

Although you sit in a room that is gray, 
Except for the silver 
Of the straw-paper, 
And pick
At your pale white gown;
Or lift one of the green beads
Of your necklace,
To let it fall;
Or gaze at your green fan
Printed with the red branches of a red willow;
Or, with one finger,
Move the leaf in the bowl - 
The leaf that has fallen from the branches of the
	forsythia 
Beside you . . . 
What is all this?
I know how furiously your heart is beating.

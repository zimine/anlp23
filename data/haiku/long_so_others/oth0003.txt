OLIVES

Fingers   
I've ten fingers  
Very much admired,
I shall frame them
For they cannot do anything;
They cannot earn dinner
Or even hold a pebble . . .
Pebbles are pretty falling through them.
 
 
Shoe-string  
Little old shoe,
You need a shoe-string;
I shall find one for you,
For without it you are helpless
As a man who studies regulations,
But with a yellow one
Like a woman who is bald.

    
Beautiful Mind 
Oh, beautiful mind,
I lost it
In a lot of frying pans
And calendars and carpets 
And beer bottles. . . .  
Oh, my beautiful mind!

Miggles   
Miggles - 
That was his name,
Everyone always said,
"Miggles did it."
Oh, Miggles,
I admired you from the beginning, 
Miggles!

    
A Room
It is a room that sets people thinking,
So they say,
Lighted like grandma's moonflowers . . .
Swish - I hear something in the corner,
Suddenly,
And I wish I were a cat.
  
  
blue undershirts  
Blue undershirts,  
Upon a line,
It is not necessary to say to you 
Anything about it - 
What they do,
What they might do . . . blue undershirts.
  
  
in bed
I am tortured
By this borrowed mattress . . .
How do you lie,
Napoleon?

in the square 
They made a statue 
Of a general on horseback,
With his face turned nobly
Toward the crupper . . .
'Twas true
Of him
Quite half the time.

    
at the door 
I have only a tingling remembrance
Not of his eyes 
But of
A dandelion . . . 
Nevertheless, 
The whole of him, 
The whole of me, 
There - 
Known, elicited, understood.
    
    
on the table 
Little duck  
Made of plaster,
With your head
Upon a spring,
When my hand trembles upon the table
You nod,
And when I chuckle too . . . Such understanding, C'est henaurme!

in the street 
Dinky, slinky,  
You must not wink
That way . . .
You hussy,
Do you forget I think For both of us?

in the orchard 
This morning,
As the quince blossoms died,
The cherries were ripening . . .
Such are all your moments,
Little one.

some where 
Now I know
I have been eating apple-pie for breakfast 
In the New England 
Of your sexuality.
 
 
 
a moon 
It lasted a month,
We had one moon . . .
You took it for a baby 
And when it cried For a bib and a bottle, 
All was over.

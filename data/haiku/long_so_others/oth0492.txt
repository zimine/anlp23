FOR YOU A TRANSIENT JOY

For you a transient joy,
	For me, all of my years; 
For you eagerness,
	For me, fears.

To you happy release,
	God's own zest; 
To me my sufferance,
	To me, unrest.

The forgetfulness is yours,
	The hour's height; 
For me the keen knowledge
	Of nights beyond this night.

Your moment's hunger
	I can a little share, 
But ever will you know
	My moment's terrible care?

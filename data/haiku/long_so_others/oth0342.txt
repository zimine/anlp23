OPUS 81

Lady, you sit and wonder why - but I cannot help 
	you.

Life poured its plenty into your lap: 
There were cocoanuts and fine-tooth combs 
And strings of strange touch, faceted with fire. 
And there were kittens of love and one jaguar. 
But there is nothing now, 
Not even your folded hands 
For they are toward heaven. 
Poor, poor lady, 
With your satin lap!

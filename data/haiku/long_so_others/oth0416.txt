MEDITATION

How long have I meditated, O Prince,
On sky and earth?
It comes to this,
That even the moon
Has exhausted its emotions.
What is it that I think of, truly?
The lines of blackberry bushes,
The design of leaves - 
Neither sky nor earth
Express themselves before me . . .
Bossuet did not preach at the funerals
Of puppets.

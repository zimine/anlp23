PORTRAIT OF MY FATHER

An oak tree with a somewhat short trunk 
But whose branches reach up high 
Is moving. It is moving slowly and rhythmically 
Under the sky which always closes it in anew, 
And feeling this sky as a gently moved log feels 
	perhaps
The water and the wind which carry it. 
Night and day which it encounters are 
Like rain and the dust; and the sky 
Soothes the worm-wounds, 
And they slowly draw up.

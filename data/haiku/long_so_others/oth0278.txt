WEARINESS

Her straight lips, grazing each other 
Have that stillness on whose edge hang many words. 
Her head is always thrown back 
As though she saw and heard a faintly singing 
	friend
Rising from a high horizon,
Shaking his flame-ringlets as he walks to her . . . 
Only the slowness of her breathing 
Tells you her dream is dead

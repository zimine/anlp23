PASTORAL

If I say I have heard voices 
Who will believe me?

		"None has dipped his hand 
		In the black waters of the sky 
		Nor picked the yellow lilies 
		That sway on their clear stems 
		And no tree has waited 
		Long enough nor still enough 
		To touch fingers with the moon."
        
I looked and there were little frogs 
With puffed out throats, 
Singing in the slime.

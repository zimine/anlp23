GESTURES

Let there be dancing figures 
On our wine-flask. 
Swastikas on our rug, 
Inscriptions in our rings 
And on our dwelling.

Let us build ritual
For our worship,
Pledge our love
With vows and holy promises.

If we break oaths
Let it be darkly
With threatening gestures. 
Thus we ignore 
That we love and die 
Like insects.

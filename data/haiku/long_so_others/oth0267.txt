ARABELLE

I dislike men.
Dislike them for the strain
They put on women.
If I didn't have to earn a living
I'd snap my fingers at this fading hair of mine
And let the colour in my cheeks
Begin to go.
I'd sit down to it
And rock my age in comfort by the fire. 
Forty-four and poor -  
If you're single - 
Is the devil of a combination for a woman.
Every time a married one
Comes in to buy a box of rouge
I'd like to tell her she's a fool to do it
When she's not obliged to look young.
Once I said as much
And the woman answered
I guess you're not married
Or you'd know the reason. . . . . .
I dislike men
For the strain they put on women

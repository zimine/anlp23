LOVE

Straight girl, whose body was that 
Of a shadowed caryatid in the blue temple of the 
	night,
You thought me your lover and knelt to me with a 
	gesture,
Although your shoulders did not drop . . .
I walked from the light-splashed darkness 
And we blew the feathers of smiles
Against each other's faces. 
And in that moment we loved,
Although you stood, afterwards, your body still
	turned to the darkness, 
While I flew on to my love.

HEART'S EASE

Say it again. It is not often
One hears "I love you."
There is much talk of the winds,
But that is of death;
And there is great chatter of birds
But there is not much in it;
And the talking of the sea
Says only over and over again
Pitiful things with sobs in them.
In the words of a woman alone
Is there that which is heart-easing.
Say it again.

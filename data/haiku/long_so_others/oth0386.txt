IN INK OF INDIA AND GOLD

			I
A windless ebon night.
White poppies spill their fragrance through the
	silence. 
The sky is gold;
The sky is hard and pure and clear.
    
The pallid petals drift and drift like snow; 
A god with beauty wounded bleeds and dies.
    
			II
Where lies this land, this land of spectral gold 
With sullen, swinging shadows deeper hued 
Whereon twist purple roads in fading curves
 With wild, black furrows where a chariot sped 
And left an angry, splendid resonance?
    
Here now two lonely peacocks, white as death, 
Fight on and on within the golden night; 
They splash the shadows with their pink, starred 
	feet.
    
			III
The splendor of a windy twilight flung
In ink of India across a screen
Which drinks its substance leaving shadowed there
Life-like to float above it - irised - rich - 
A burnished peacock which the great winds beat
To swirling emerald and stern sapphire - 
Gold goblin eyes aghast within a sea.
    
Panels of soft darkness;
Down they drop
O'er faded summer flowers,
O'er ragged balls of white seed-dotted cotton.
    
			IV
    
Monstrous twilights;
	False and gilded dawns 
O'er silences of water.
	A fin, slanting, shines; 
Shrieking sea-gulls
	Shoot like arrows down.

			V
A tattered square of beaten silk - white - dull -  
Well sprinkled with a dust of powdered gold 
The thirsty silk has kept and left but light; 
In ink of India sketched - a winter's night; 
Cold leagues of space. 
One little maid;
Her white face wounds the night.
    
Two million-petaled winter plum trees near 
Spray the darkness with soft flower-stars.

THE CRYSTAL

A man wants me:
Because the curves of my neck sing to him
And the shape of my body tortures his dreams
A man wants me.
He looks into the crystal
And sees visions. . . .
Two lovers in the garden of Eternity
Plucking the rose. . . .
A House built upon a rock
With an open door
And eager children flitting up to it. . . . 
These are his happy visions.
Once I looked into the crystal,
I will not look again,
The picture moves across the curtains of my eyelids
	 still,
I close them and remember 
Barbarie figures, 
Brute man hunting his mate 
Whom having captured 
He proceeds to woo
With the conventional club of the period. 
The uncouth struggle over, she 
Rising enraptured from the dust 
Kneels
And with bruises burning sweet as kisses 
In a fury of worship 
Surrenders herself.

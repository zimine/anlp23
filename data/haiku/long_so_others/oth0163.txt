"ICY SHORES"

Why has the sea hurled itself on the land 
Now that summer is gone 
And winter is the big player?
				Neither is the winner.
Both strugglers, sea and land,
Are locked in a standstill.
Only the ice is a victim.
It happened to be caught between.
So the ledges are crumpled . . broken playthings.
They are equal to a toy town of blocks
Kicked over by children
Who are gone away.

DOROTHY

There are tawny sunsets in your eyes, 
And deserts and a sleek wind 
Sifting the yellow sand. . .

Vexatious bubbles break upon our lips 
And our souls, fretted, throw off a light foam. 
But when I look at you
I am aware of spaces and a glittering peace. 
Come - 
On the mesa there must be a shadowed place. . . 
You will bring me dreams in gourds 
While I rest as under a palm.

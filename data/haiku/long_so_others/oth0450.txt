UNCLOTHED

Your soul met mine 
on a windy branch 
the time we died.

"Good lack, 
what a night!" 
you whined at me.

I always thought
your soul had black hair,
a bit curled,
and lovable gray eyes, 
and arms,
stout, caressing, like an oak.

The truth of the matter is: 
it was skinny 
with nothing much at all 
to recommend it.

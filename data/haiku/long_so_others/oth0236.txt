TO YOU

The city
Wedged between impulse and unfolding 
Bridged
By diurnal splintering
Of egos
Round
The aerial news-kiosk 
Where you 
Statically 
Hob-nob 
With a nigger 
And a deaf-mute 
Of introspection

Plopping finger
In Stephen's ink
Made you hybred-negro

A couple of manuscriptural erasures 
And here we have your deaf-mute 
Beseech him
He will never with-hold so 
Completely
As the tattle of tongue-play 
Or your incognito

Lit cavities in the face of the city
Open their glassy embrace to receive you
In your mask of unborn ebony 
And the silence of your harangue

The tight-rope stretched above commotion
Frays to tow
To the step tentative
And shadows are yours for the taking
Where the mono-rabble
Plays the one-stringed banjo
On the noise of its ragged heart
Inaudible
In the shattering city 
Alien as your aboriginal 
In the levelling dirt -

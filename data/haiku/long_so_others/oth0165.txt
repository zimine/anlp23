"SOLITUDE"

I can have this cool loneliness
And you can take along what you want
Here of this cool loneliness.
It is not like prairie land
Nor a single crag
Nor a level of ocean.
Little hills around it
Keep off winter,
The big rough player.
A disc of cool loneliness,
I always ask it:
What are you waiting for?
It seems so sure somebody is coming.

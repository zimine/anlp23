REALITY


Low-burnt light 
In the waning night 
In the brown, broken station:
			These
The present things,
			Far off
And little felt.
But pressing close
The too uncertain thought of you,
O Greatly Wished,
And the feel of dear love upon my throat.

Clattering into the brown, broken station,
In the waning night
In the low-burnt light;
Falling across my thighs,
And cursing me
With liquor-stinking breath - 
			These were the ways
Of three tired whores.
			One shivered 
Beneath a draggled coat;
			One leered
From under a broad-brimmed hat;
			One had grey eyes, 
And a tinge of light about her hair.

At last the train,
And we went creaking on a while,
Until the door opened like a mouth
Vexed and sick
And belched them out,
A vomit on the night.
			One had grey eyes, 
And a tinge of light about her hair.
			These
The present things,
			Far off,
And little felt.
But pressing close
The too uncertain thought of you,
O Greatly Wished,
And the memory of dear love upon my throat!

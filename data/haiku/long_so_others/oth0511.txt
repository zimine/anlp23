POEME EROTIQUE

How do you know that I do not love you? 
Because I have never sung of my love? 
Are you not sick of the songs of men?

I shall not sing. For I have heard the wildcat calling at midnight. 
I shall not sing. For I have heard the robin warbling at dawn.

I shall not even speak. For I have seen two snakes basking side
	by side in the noonday sun. 
I shall not even speak. For I have seen the dragonflies, by twos,
	darting above the swamps.

Down by the river an old road
runs through the pines, along the bank.
The river glitters through the pines
at one hand. At the other hand
loom the first pines of a dark, deep wood.
One never meets another, there.
Once in a while a distant shout resounds - 
a swimmer's shout - 
indolently,
wildly pure,
like the bark of a fox
or the bleat of a lamb,
somewhere afar.
Once in a while
a catbird sings
within the wood.
Every day
the catbird sings,
once in a while.

Tomorrow, let us walk along the road, 
and I will let the catbird sing my song. 
But we must be as silent as two snakes.

DIRGE OF THE WORK-HORSES

Slowly they pass along the pavement,
Slowly they linger,
With drooping heads
And draggled manes;
Life holds no more in store for them,
Towards the knacker's yard
	They go. 
Wrecks of the city,
	Worn-out horses.

Pitiful, mean,
Ashamed that they have so soon to die,
Lifting spiritless
Their useless hoofs,
Pulling wearily
With nerveless withers,
Towards oblivion,
The gas-lamps and the docks of oblivion,
	They go; 
Wrecks of the city,
	Worn-out horses.

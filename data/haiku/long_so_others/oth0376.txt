PORTRAIT OF A GENTLEMAN

Tower of stone 
Rugged and lonely - 
    
My thoughts, like ivy 
Embrace my memory of you, 
Climbing riotously, wantonly, 
Till the harsh walls
Are clothed in tender green.
    
Tower of stone - 
Stark walls and a narrow door
Which speak:
	"You who are not for me
    	Are against me - 
    	If you are mine,
    	Enter!" . . . . 
But who would be prisoned 
In unknown darkness!
    
Tower of stone 
Rugged and lonely,
I dared not enter and I would not go
Till clasping you
My arms were bruised and torn.

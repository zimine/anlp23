PIERROT

To-morrow will pass like other days. 
Fear, hate, anger, 
and at times. . . . 
peace.
This till I'm with her. 
Then pain, anger, contempt, 
and in rare moments, 
peace.
    
Through it all this pitiless unrest
will hold me fast,
till I must go
terrified and blank,
sombre like this street,
these lowering houses,
and she who watches
from trivial curtains
my footfalls sucked into eternity.

THE ROOM IS AS WE LEFT

The room is as we left it 
But mellowed to a heightened 
Dignity. 
The chairs
Have summer coverings 
Of cobwebs,
The teakwood lamps are there,
And still the bed sags
To the center,
And the table throws
Its weight of shadow
On the spread . . . .
. . . Folly to have left the room unused:
You did not merit such a nicety . . . .

A ragged ache of light 
Sifts through the dust: 
Blotches
A grotesque of the present 
Upon the patterns of the past . . . 
My hands are bruised by surfaces 
I do not see,
My fingers falter up and down 
A tracery of years, 
I sense the echo of a voice 
I do not hear,
I am not sure the breath 
I hold 
Is mine.

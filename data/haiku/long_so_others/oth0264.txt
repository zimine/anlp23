RETRIBUTION

I want to hurt you 
For once - not long ago - someone hurt me. 
I know the way to madden you 
And gladden you
And leave you with smirched pride, 
Trembling between love and hate,
     
Yes, I know that hell!
For not so long ago I felt my heart twist
With hard pain,
And tried to smile,
But something moved again, so that I only wept,
And all my sweetness slipped into the dark. . . . . .
That is why I want to hurt you.

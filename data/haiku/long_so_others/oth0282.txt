PORTRAIT

Her face is the tall, sun scrubbed corner 
Of a garden wall of red and white stone. 
Shadow whips die almost before they have slowly 
	beaten
The colored straightness of the wall, 
A slender boy in red and white comes 
And sits him down - you must look twice 
And long, to part him from the wall. 
He sings with tender disdain until
He sees you.
Then, frightened, he gives you bubbling laughs 
And talks, to make you forget him.

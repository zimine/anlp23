LIFE

			I
The sky is the thin, strong expanse of a God, 
And the trees are lines of black Hindus 
Praying in black, shrivelled attitudes.

			II
The grass is a priest in dream-gold cloth, 
Lying on its back, hard with years of thought-
	pinning.
The lateral-grey, snarled clouds over him 
Are the thoughts he has woven.

			III
The slender lagoon holds the laughter of a child 
With his lips to a long, full cup.

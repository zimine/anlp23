NORMA LEE: A LUSTRUM

Dark eyes of Father Joseph, 
You taught her 
The luminous escape 
From the intricacies 
Which Sister Laurenta 
Had looped about her. . . .
    
Would she with the midges 
Hover out of copses 
Through the lanes and gardens? 
Would she with the midges 
Flitter moons and midnights 
In profligate succession? . . .
    
The panels drawn by her
Had but revealed
The dearth of what she sought:
There was darkness and no glow.
And as she turned within her thoughts
She saw the gropings of her year
Like green mice
Hopping trepidant
On crimson rugs. . . .
    
Somewhere in the cellar of the night 
She had left
The burnt-out perfumed tapers
She had lit for him,
And the songs that danced about them
Had perished
With their spent fragrance. 
Groaning 
She stumbled 
With heavy feet
Up the huge steps of morning. . . .
    
He was forever - this other - 
He was forever taking fishes
On air adventures;
He was forever wondering
At their gaspings.
But now
The meshed rings of her laughter
Caught him
Dangling
Quivering to her pleasure,
And his strength
Could not cut
The silver of it.
- How happiness stroked her!

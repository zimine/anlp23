OLD MAN IN A HAMMOCK

Below the rippling voices of trees - 
Voices lower than the whispers of children
And like the fluttering of spirit-tongues - 
The old man slowly swung
In his gold and lavender hammock.
His eyes, under moving lids,
Seemed drops of water falling beneath the sun. 
They saw nothing. . . .
The motion of the gold and lavender hammock 
Had become his life.

A DAY AND ITS JOURNEY

The dawn came in
Fever-swift and hot. . . .
And I ran from its touch and clasp. . . .
And all my roads wound upward
To the hills,
And there they ceased. . . .
The hills received me,
And in unharried valleys
My spent and blowing soul
Was stilled and calmed and recreated. . . .
And the lowlands,
With the netted roads
And clotted houses
Were phantoms of a dream.

Cool and finger-soft
The night crept in,
Slipping on from peak to peak. . . .
And I found my roads again,
Winding roads that downward wound
To the lowlands
Where they ceased
And were unraveled,
Into sundry quiet streets. . . .
And lights were glowing,
Amid the ample trees
Like little errant stars;
And all the houses,
White and trim,
Were dimly dancing in the dusk
Around the luminous square;
For all the world they seemed
As many maidens
Waiting
Each her lover and his coming. . . . 
I was home again.

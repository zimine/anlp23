TRIFLES

I have gathered wild roses by the roadside, 
I have stolen cherries from my neighbors, 
I have ridden gay young horses, 
I have laughed till my eyes were wet; 
	I have paddled under the willows, 
	I have danced till the lights melted into dawn, 
	I have smuttied my nose smelling tiger-lilies;
		I have struggled breast to breast with a foaming 
			sea,
		And half drowned in its rush; 
			I have taken kisses in the dark; 
				Tell me:
					What else is good?

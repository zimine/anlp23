LENTO

Two children	walking.

So slow their walk,
So like a sleepy wind their talk - 

Arm sagging at the other's waist, 
Close as leaves fallen on wet grass - 

Their slippers follow oily waves of heat, 
Lazy as gorged fishes, 
Lazy as minutes
Swimming in the silence of an empty house 
In midsummer - 

The drifting yellow ashes of the sun 
cover their hair - 

So slow they are,
The drowsy seconds settle on their shoulders 
and fold wings - 

And one small footstep	sings 
To the next one 
A lullaby - 

The hours wait them	at the gate, 
Sighing,
As the little feet	tick by.

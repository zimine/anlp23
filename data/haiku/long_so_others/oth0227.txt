ILLUSIONS

			1.
Green fingers lifting a pebble,
green fingers uncurling,
the slant and splash of a waterdrop
between eternities;
earth slipping from old roots,
and the stealth of white petals in the sun
all day long;

brown chimney pots 
descending against a cloud 
in silence; 
between walls
the dry whir of a sparrow's wings . . . 
am I these, or more?

			2.

Night,
old prowler through the streets of my body, 
night,
with a heavy moon on your shoulder -  
I descend from the roofs to track you.

			3.
Clear eyed flame 
betrayer of earth
draw back from the sun!
Go in once more
to the wet grains, your secret. . .
We who walk
alone
have a fear of tale bearers.

			4.
We hear rain,
and our hearts are paved with it; 
we hear rain,
and in the darkness we turn and cry.
Silver drops shake in the dust,
the dust will be pitted,
we open our eyes, sightless,
we are afraid.

			5
Where there is dew,
our footsteps
will be black.
But where there is sun,
who will follow?

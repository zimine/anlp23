TO H.S.

Those people out there
moving about in mist,
dancing mist,
dancing blue-gray mist,
gravely gay dancing mist - 
(or do they do the dancing?)
are always coming so close to you,
you're always going so close to them - 
but you never touch.

Don't you love them? 
Queer beautiful things. 
Mist people. 
Moving mist people. 
Dancing mist people. 
You ought to -  
you're one of them.

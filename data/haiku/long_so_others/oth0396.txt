THE CONVENT

	Nice to be God . . . 
My passions sit in long white rows 
within the little chapel 
sending incense up to me 
or fast singing in lonely cells 
or walk whispering together thru grey cloisters. 
Last night a wild cat novice broke her vows 
and now her sisters wear away the stone 
praying for her.
    
They cannot guess who slipped the bolts 
	Who rode with her 
	Who gave her to her lover . . . 
		Nice to be God . . .

THE OLD MEN

Old men who have studied e
very leg show 
in the city,
old men cut from touch 
by the perfumed music, 
polished or fleeced skulls 
that stand before 
the whole theater 
in silent attitudes 
of attention,
old men who have taken precedence
over young men and even
over dark-faced husbands
whose minds are a street
with arc-lights,
solitary old men for whom
we find no excuses:
I bow my head in shame
for those who malign you. 
Old men,
the peaceful beer of impotence 
be yours!

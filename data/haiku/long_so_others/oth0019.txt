I AM ALADDIN

			I
        
I am Aladdin.
Wanting a thing I have but to snap my fingers.
Jinn, bring me a lady,
The lady with the magic kiss
That turns troubles into joys.
The lady of the soft white throat
And shell-tint cheeks.
Ah, here you are, Lady!
Thank you, Jinn.
Lady, sing to me,
A song as gorgeous as the plumage of a Bird of Paradise.
Music melts in your mouth
Becoming vaporous perfume
Utterly intoxicating me
Now you may dance for me a while.
Weave a delirious design
With your body,
Ah, you are like a gold fish
Glinting gaily
Darting through sparkling waters.
There, that will do, Lady.
Say you love me, now.
Yes, yes, I believe you.
I could not doubt that voice of yours
As full of the abandon of expression
As your dance.
And now, Lady,
The magic kiss!
Ummm! That is good.
Jinn, take her away.

The other night I dreamed 
Of a shimmering opalescent mermaid 
Sitting on a shell of mother of pearl 
With her tail cocked up on the edge 
Quite saucily.
She was blowing soap bubbles, 
Irridescent,
And flirting with a rainbow fish.
I awoke with a stinging in my eyes
As though one of her gay drifting bubbles
Had burst in my face
With a spatter of soap suds.
But I could not believe that,
Knowing the bite came from bitter tears,
I had seen her only in a dream,
And that I
Could never be
A rainbow fish.

I love anything ostentatious
Simpler things I despise.
I like to hear a nose blown with a bang
See teeth picked with a flourish
Watch a fat lady wabble her cargo of flesh
As though it were worth a thousand dollars an ounce.
I think ostentation of any sort
Is just grand.

Big footed people
Go about stepping on things;
Ideals, egos, the cosmos
They crush
Clod-hopperdly.
        
I should hate to have the epidermis
Of an ornithorincus
On the sole of an elephantine foot.
I prefer skipping lightly across egg shells
In padded Chinese slippers with blue embroidered tops.

Fly speck,
You are such a neat, tidy, unimportant 
Little thing
That no one takes offense 
At sight of you 
Or mention of your name. 
But you irritate me
With your polite little airs of decency
Why don't you grow up
And be something?
Even a fly speck
Can aspire to be
A manure heap.

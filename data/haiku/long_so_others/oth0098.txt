THE SEA

Far out into the sea the tide-bared straggling reefs have
		crept, and I lie there as one of them.
Above and before me, the sun-dashed joyous blue sings
		one clear note of whole-world blitheness.
The great sea is quiet, only endless quivering light-tipped
			ripples show that it breathes,
While afar off pale haze-limned sails steal faintly by like 
	dreams, the dreams of our deeds yet to do - 
My eyes close:
Hot and hotter the noon sun beats on the shimmering
				sea, the rocks, and me - 
It runs through my blood till I become all warmth and
						light - 
Till the whole world is turned into warmth and light -  
No world, no I, but only warmth and light, red-flimmer-
				ing, flickering warming light!

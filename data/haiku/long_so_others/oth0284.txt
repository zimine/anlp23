FRIENDSHIP

Grey, drooping-shouldered bushes scrape the edges 
Of bending swirls of yellow-white flowers. 
So do my thoughts meet the wind-scattered color of 
	you.

The green-shadowed trance of the water
Is splintered to little, white-tasseled awakenings
By the beat of long black oars.
So do your words cut the massed smoothness of 
	thoughts of you.

Split, brown-blue clouds press into each other, 
Over hills dressed in mute, clinging haze. 
So do my thoughts slowly form over the draped 
	mystery of you.

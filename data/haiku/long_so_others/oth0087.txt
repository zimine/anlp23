THREE DIMENSIONS

Several small houses 
Discreetly separated by foliage
And the night - 
Maintaining their several identities 
By light

Which fills the inside of each - 
Not as masses they stand
But as walls
Enclosing and excluding
Like shawls

About little old women -  
What mystery hides within 
What curiosity lurks without 
One the other 
Knows nothing about.

SOUVENIR OF DOMINICA

And from now on
The perfume of roses
Will evoke memories of Roseau
And its valley dreamy with haze,
And Morne Anglais sulking in a cloud,
And the Pitons insolent on a clear day,
And rainbows and rainbows and rainbows;
But against them all
A shingled house and its mango tree,
A shingled house and its scarlet passion-flowers,
A shingled house and its white-bloomed ixora
Iridescent with humming-birds;
An old gray gabled home,
With Miss Maud playing fairy to the ferns,
And Miss Carrie trying hard to look severe,
And Miss Alice, very stately, pouring tea:
Three dear friendly gentlewomen
Smiling at me from the hearts of roses!

HER FIRST LOVE

Leaning over her while she lay 
thrown back across my knees, . . .  
I bruised her lips 
and the small hard breasts 
with strainings and caresses.

She does not move. . . 
says nothing
Is she wondering what it all means?
    
But now and then her eyes water, their lids droop,
and her lips quiver.
Her face grows darker. . .
She strains me to her desperately. . .
    
It's hard to know what these young girls want!

INTERLUDE - NOSTALGIE DE L'INFINI

You tangoed with him 
on the lawn 
in the moon, 
and I smiled.
    
At times you'd be strong, 
walk to me.
You did not think I shook; 
hated you.
    
And when you'd dance with me, 
I went away.
    
Why do you tell me these years after, 
you wept for a long night?

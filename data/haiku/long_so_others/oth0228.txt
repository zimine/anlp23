THE FLIGHT

They locked the doors: they barred the windows, 
By stealth took shoes from me and stockings,
	But you passed up the street
	Whistling my song
	Calling my name.

On naked feet, coatless, hatless, bleeding, 
	I ran - 
	No words between, no foolish words, 
You only took my hand, we went on together, 
Walking the streets all night, 
Walking the tragic streets. 
Dawn found us on a sleepy bench, 
Two happy owls blinking at sunrise.

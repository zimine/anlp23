THE GEAR CUTTER

This master is a slave
to three greedy gear cutters.
They shape arms and legs
on solid bronze disks
and blow stray chips
on his garment, beard and face,
the face of the Man
who was born on the road to Egypt.
He heeds not the winged chips
nor the dirt laden drops of oil.
He walks on brown velvet clouds,
anoints the machines with oil
and the disks are faces of children.

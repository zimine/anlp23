AT CETARA

One April morning 
On the beach at Cetara 
He read:
"I am waiting at Salerno, 
Come-"
And his love rose like a slender cone 
Piercing into heaven
(Far above the brown-legged men and women
Dragging at long nets
Of writhing silver fishes)
So that he spun
Like a dizzy top
On the apex of his love.

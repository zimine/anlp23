CLEAVING

The darkness meditates
Upon the ghost of a moon-strand
That crept into it, and died.
So do I think of you, after parting.

The dark green sea
Has the darker shadow of a cloud
That scampers over it.
So does your soul come to me
After we walk away.

A thin blue morning, shaped like a bell, 
Hangs in a last tower and never moves. 
So do you seem, after you have gone.

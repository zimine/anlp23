BALLET

Are you not weary, 
great gold cross 
shining in the wind -  
are you not weary 
of seeing the stars 
turning over you 
and the sun 
going to his rest 
and you frozen with 
a great lie 
that leaves you 
rigid as a knight 
on a marble coffin?

- and you, 
higher still,
	robin, 
untwisting a song 
from the bare 
top-twigs, 
are you not 
weary of labor, 
even the labor of a song?

Come down - join me 
for I am lonely.

First it will be
a quiet pace
to ease our stiffness
but as the west yellows
you will be ready!

Here in the middle 
of the roadway 
we will fling 
ourselves round 
with dust lilies 
till we are bound in 
their twining stems!
We will tear
their flowers
with arms flashing!

And when
the astonished stars
push aside
their curtains
they will see us
fall exhausted where
wheels and
the pounding feet
of horses
will crush forth
our laughter.

EXPECTATION

Some morning on opening the door of my office
I shall find a baby in old green onyx:
Its torso will be heavy about the lower part
	And somewhat contorted; 
The feet in a whimsical strained position 
But with no arms - just rounded off at the 
	shoulders;
Its lips and eyes will be frozen in a tantalizing and
	almost obscene grin. 
On its back will be painted in beautiful colors but 
In a hieroglyphics which no one ever saw 
A message which will be quite plain to me.

HEMSTITCHES

Lasses,
I could do better
hemstitches for you
if I were a woman - 
preferably not your mother - 
but try to imagine
that though I loved such as you
older than you
I will never love you,
and I will sew you something
you can tuck away
in the secret drawer of your dresser
you may take out
if only to try on near your glass
on such nights
when you are lonesome
and no boy gives you a thought.

MEETING

A mood whose lips had kissed walls of moonlight
Met another mood whose heart was a flagon of ashes
Holding a little sleeping wine-song.
The first mood kissed the breast of the other,
And the little wine-song leapt up
And filled the flagon with his pale purple breath.
Then the two moods died, and he who bore them,
Being an old man, sat down to make others.

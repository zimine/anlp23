KELLER GEGEN DOM

Witness, would you - 
one more young man,
in the evening of his love
hurrying to confession,
steps down a gutter
crosses a street
goes in at a doorway,
opening for you
like some great flower
a room filled with lamplight;
or whirls himself
obediently to
the curl of a hill
some wind-dancing afternoon;
lies for you in
the futile darkness of
a wall, sets stars dancing
to the crack of a leaf - 
and leaning his head away
snuffs (secretly)
the bitter powder from
his thumb's hollow,
takes your blessing and goes home to bed?

Witness instead
whether you like it or not
a dark vinegar smelling place
from which trickles
the chuckle of
beginning laughter.

It strikes midnight.

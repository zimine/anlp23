AFTER-PAIN

Hill flowers salute his feet
As he parts them, climbing a slender path.
They are flowers of breath-like pain 
Growing near the crest of every happiness he has. 
He stoops and runs his fingers over them, 
Then hurries to his white-pillared shelter of hap-
	piness, 
With a queer reverence.

THE DANCER

	They were godly people, all of them, 
With whom I dined 
In the cafe that night - 
Substantial citizens
With their virtuous wives 
And a stray daughter or two. . . .
And when I spoke my admiration of your dancing, -  
You, the little half-clothed painted cabaret performer 
Who was pirouetting before us, -  
I received a curious answer. -  
It was only as the absurd voicing 
Of a preposterous fancy
That one of the virtuous wives said to me - 
"Why don't you go over and dance with her yourself!"
Her voice stung me, - it was so sure
That to dance with you would be a shameful and
	unpleasant thing. 
So I answered crossly -  "For a nickel I would." 
And one of the daughters,
Who doubtless suffered later for her evil act, 
Handed me the nickel. . . . . .

	And that was how it came to be 
That you and I
Before the gaping herd of my respectable fellow-
	townsmen
Forgot the world.
Light was the pressure of your hand
And your body was as answering to my touch
As is a little willow to the wind.
I could not see your painted face against my shoulder; 
I forgot that you were clad in veils to lure the lustful 
	crowd;
The tawdry glitter of the hour faded and died 
As you and I soared up 
Upon the music. 
O soul of a bird!
O cooling wind from the mountains of wild laurel! 
O dreamer of a pattern of whirling stars 
Down which we moved 
In dizzy orbits!
Perfumes of Arabia were around us;
Tremulous melody heard by none other
Out of some distant garden poured in wild song.
And there were lights in the air;
And there were memories
Of forgotten Thracian hillsides,
And madness, and oblivion,
And a fierce white peace.

	Then the dance ended. . . . .
And you were once more a little painted harlot 
In an ugly cafe
Before a vulgar audience.
So I led you back to your table 
And thanked you conventionally, 
And turned to go. -  But a sudden impulse
Swept me. - 
And in the sight of all the gaping respectabilities
I turned to you again
And kissed you
In recognition and farewell
To that winged spirit which you late had been.

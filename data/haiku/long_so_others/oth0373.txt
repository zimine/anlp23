AT THE VICE

A bastard file cuts his days 
while he is held tight 
like the piece of copper 
in his vice.
And he is swayed over it
with a file in his two hands
to shape it for another life.
He has long ago passed the scratch
that means stop
and he moves on as if blind.
There is a silk gowned worm
gnawing at his heart.

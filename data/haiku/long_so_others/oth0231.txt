DAWNS

I have gone 
from pride
all the way up to humility 
this day-to-night. 
The hill
was more terrible 
than ever before.

Near the top
you may note a tall slim tree. 
It isn't bent; it doesn't lean. 
It is only looking back.

At dawn,
under that tree,
still another me of mine
was buried.

Waiting for me to come again, 
humorously solicitous
of what I bring next, 
it looks down.

DEFEAT

The pit is lined sharply with stones - 
My bones are broken too. . .
This would be hard to bear
if I had not plucked the feathers of dead dreams
to pillow it.
I shall not move for a long while - 
I am out with stars
since that last encounter
and I need no companions
other than the strange slim shapes of laughter
that come twisting out of tears
and circling close
to touch my wounds
with rainbow breath.

QUEST

Mist 
Grey
Tremulous
And a mighty current beat:
Then sound ceased
And light was all,
Restless, tumultuous,
Then Peace.
And from the midst
A flower
White.
And one by one 
The petals turned 
Till they hung 
Seven radiating flames. 
And again
The petals fell away
And the calyx was upborne.
Silence
Peace
Mist
The return. 

Love.
Not that bright Flaming-winged 
But Very-love.

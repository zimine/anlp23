SUNDAY IN A CERTAIN CITY SUBURB

Four men whose lives are the beginning of sun-
				silenced afternoons,
And whose orange and red scarfs are the sole flowers 
Of the washed-out afternoons,
Sit, shifting dominoes.
The afternoon outside of them dies, as fruit slowly
				pressed between fingers,
But still the four stiff men shift dominoes . . .
Their wives, wide women with tight, garnished hair,
Sit in the back-yard, whispering tiny secrets and

			munching strings of grapes.
Their lives are the centers of half-cloudy days,
With now and then a noisy evening
In which they hang the crude little japanese-lanterns
					of their thoughts 
On the ever-swaying strings of their minds . . .

The domino-box is folded, the grapes are eaten. 
Children, wheezing and limp, return.

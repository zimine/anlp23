DOLCE

In the great clouds, there is rain. 
A swift rain. 
A rain that kills.
And a slow rain.
A rain that comes like leaves.

I would be the slow rain.

In the hills, there is a god 
who rolls from side to side.

In the valley, a no-god 
who lifts his arm like a tree.

I would be this one.

In the streets, there are children. 
And there are old people. 
Very old people.

I would not be the children, 
but the old people, 
the very old people.

There is a woman.
Big with gentle yielding.

I would be like her.

LEGEND

When I think of life now 
It is in terms of faery.
I am living the old legend 
Of the sprite
With a body of fire and light
And no soul,
Who fled to earth
Longing to gain a soul
Through human love and sorrow.
I know myself that sprite
As I know the country that is tucked away
Between the mists of dawn and day
As I am aware
Of the faery lover I had there,
And when I go to walk
With meek hair smoothed
And modest as a mortal bride should be,
A shadow waits for me,
My phantom lover waits invisibly cloaked
At every corner, on every street,
He stands whistling my song,
Calling my name,
And I will not hear,
My ears are sharpened to a sweeter sound. 
I listen, I follow my own soul 
As it goes up the way ahead of me 
Blowing on ghostly pipes 
Of immortality.

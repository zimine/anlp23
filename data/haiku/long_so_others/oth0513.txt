SERENADE

Come on, don't be afraid you'll spoil me 
if you light the gas in your room 
and show me
that you have heard my cries.

Are you so poor in kisses
that you're so stingy with them;
and is your heart so ravaged
that you won't let me pick there
one or two flowers
to stick in my jacket's
button-hole?

I play my serenade 
beating with my clenched fist 
on a gong and a drum. 
What I want is to give you 
the sound of what a man is.

I love my eyes and lips
better than yours;
besides, the dampness of the night
pierces my shoes.

I can be as capricious
as you can be, don't worry!

Come on, open that window 
or I'll go home.

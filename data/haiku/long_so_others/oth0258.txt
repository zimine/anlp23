MATRIX

I stretch my hands out toward you;
And by all the ways that are surer than seeing
I see that they are filled with gifts of your giving;
A coronet tipped with leaves and star dust,
And little slippers of gold with wings upon them.
And a glowing girdle of crimson,
And coin of royal mintage.
     
I hold my hands up to you;
And by all the ways that one knows without knowing 
I know that you know I have filled them with gifts
	for your taking; 
A cloak of eider as softly warm as satisfied desire, 
And a clasp of living emerald to hold it, 
And tingling wine in a jeweled goblet, 
And a rare red rose to grace it.
     
But the cruel resolvent of actuality 
Is fallen upon them:
And I stand and gaze at my upturned hands; 
And they are only full 
Of wistfulness.

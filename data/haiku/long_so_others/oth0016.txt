APPEAL

You who are so mighty, 
Crimson salamander, 
Hear me once more.
        
I lay among the half burned sticks
At the edge of the fire.
The fiend was creeping in.
I felt the cold tips of fingers - .
        
O crimson salamander!
        
Give me one little flame, 
One!
That I may bind it 
Protectingly about the wrist 
Of him that flung me here, 
Here upon the very center!
        
This is my song.

AFTER LIFE

I'm dead, 
and all that, 
but - 
I just had
a most hateful experience.
The undertaker's assistant
(I never liked her anyhow)
in fixing me
for the coffin,
did my hair low
over my forehead - 
you know
how like a jay
that makes me look - 
and crossed the hand
with the birthmark on it
over the other - 
the cat!

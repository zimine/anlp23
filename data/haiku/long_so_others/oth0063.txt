PARK GOING TO SLEEP

The shadows under the trees
And in the vines by the boat-house
Grow dark;
And the lamps gleam softly.

On the street, far off,
The sound of the cars, rumbling,
Moves drowsily.
The rocks grow dim on the edges of the shore.

The boats with tired prows against the landing 
Have fallen asleep heavily: 
The monuments sleep 
And the trees
And the smooth slow-winding empty paths sleep.

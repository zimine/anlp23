THE YOUNG HOUSEWIFE

At ten A. M. the young housewife 
moves about in neglige behind 
the wooden walls of her husband's house. 
I pass solitary in my car.

Then again she comes to the curb
to call the ice-man, fish-man, and stands
shy, uncorseted, tucking in
stray ends of hair, and I compare her
to a fallen leaf.

The noiseless wheels of my car 
rush with a crackling sound over 
dried leaves as I bow and pass smiling.

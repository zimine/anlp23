CHANSON TRISTE

My heart is sorrowful and my dreams are broken, 
The light of the sun shines not upon my house.

	I went into the forest
	Treading the dry leaves
	And I saw two gleaming black eyes.

	I thought it was a tiger
	And my bones cried out in terror.

	I thought it was a snake
	And my soul writhed in anguish.

	I tumbled on a wet tree-root
		And fell fainting into the morass, 
	The green toads croaked at me
		The mud oozed round my belly. . . .
		I turned and saw
		Two black gleaming eyes. . . .

My heart is sorrowful and my dreams are broken, 
The light of the sun shines not upon my house.

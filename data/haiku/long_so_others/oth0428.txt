NEW

Tree after tree with a mist of new leaves. . .
A white-backed flicker
Dipping across a field of old corn
To a new field. . .
In a doorway a baby
Flashing against the iron of the world
A new smile. . .
Between two ties of the track,
Undoing with its brief gold
All the vaults of the earth,
A single dandelion.

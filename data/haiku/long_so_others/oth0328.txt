OPUS 360

	The great lecturer, 
(So described in his prospectuses,) 
Paused over his tea, and then said to me - 
	"I don't even remember her name; 
But she was pretty.
There were four hundred, - all girls, -  
And there stood I 
In pants
Looking down at this soft sea.
Lapping waves, lapping waves!
But this particular girl
Lifted a splintered edge of basalt
Above the undulations.
I could feel her grate against my keel,
Quite as pointed as she was pretty.
And her sharp resistance
To my white-sailed progress around the bay 
Sticks in my mind like a scar streaking my copper 
	hull.
I don't even remember her name; 
But she was pointed, surely, 
And pretty."

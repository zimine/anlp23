DAY-DREAMINGS

You'll be sorry later on -  
for I'll come back
and, chancing on you in some public place,
you'll tremble. I'll be bronzed;
contempt upon my face;
ah . . . not for vou,
only that I'll have seen strong men dying.
She that's fairest will be on my arm
and in my pocket a thousand pounds.
    
You'll laugh
in spasms of fear . . . your eyes will go blank. . 
and I'll not sleep for thinking of you 
wide-eved at his side.

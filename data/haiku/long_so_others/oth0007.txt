VARIATIONS

			WIZARDRY
Your hands, 
so strong, 
so cool, 
wizards
improvising sleep 
. . . 
     
			VARIATION
Till you came -  
I was I.
     
			CARESS
It was as though one of those trees - 
the very tallest of them,
that compassionate one - 
had bent over me for a moment.
     
			MARCH
The air is drenched with the noise of wind. 
I with the noise of you,

			WILLOWS
     
This amphitheater of willows
praying that tarn,
are my mes
in constant attendance
on you.

			CONTRA MUNDUM
There is one sanctuary 
that is never shut -  
to you.
     
			PER CONTRA
Don't weep. 
There is sanctuary 
from me, 
as well. 
Come.
     
			PRIEST
I burn candles, 
candles - 
and no two alike -  
at an altar.

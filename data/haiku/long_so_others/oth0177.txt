DISILLUSION

I touch Joy and it crumbles under my fingers. 
The dust from it rises and fills the world. 
It blinds my eyes, I cannot see the sun. 
A choking fog of dust shuts me apart.

I remember the sparkling wind on a sharp autumn morn-
	ing.
I let down my hair and danced in the golden gale, 
Then chased the wind as the wind chased fallen leaves -  
Wind cannot be caught and tamed like a bird.

I touch Joy and it crumbles to dust in my fingers.

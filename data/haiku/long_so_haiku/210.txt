THE COUNTRY HOUSE

Did the door move, or was it always ajar?
The gladioli on the table are pale mauve.
I smell pale mauve and blue,
Blue soft like bruises - putrid - ooz-
	ing - 
The air oozes blue - mauve - 
And the door with the black line where
	it does not shut!

I must pass that door to go to bed,
Or I must stay here
And watch the crack
Oozing air.

Is it - air?

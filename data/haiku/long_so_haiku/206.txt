WAKEFULNESS

Jolt of market-carts;
Steady drip of horses' hoofs on hard pave-
	ment;
A black sky lacquered over with blueness,
And the lights of Battersea Bridge
Pricking pale in the dawn.
The beautiful hours are passing
And still you sleep!
Tired heart of my joy,
Incurved upon your dreams,
Will the day come before you have
	opened to me?

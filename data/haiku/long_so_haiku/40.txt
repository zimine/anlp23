CHICAGO RIVER

Slowly, by the slimy wooden wharves,
Through the stillness of rain
The Chicago River glides into night.
From the silhouette of a black iron bridge,
The watchman's light is dripping - 
Dripping like melting tallow.
Out of darkness
Comes a woman,
Hellos to me; her wet face glares;
Casually she turns and goes
Into the darkness.

Through the stillness of rain
The Chicago River glides on.

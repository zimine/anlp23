STREETS

As I wandered through the eight hun-
	dred and eight streets of the city,
I saw nothing so beautiful
as the Women of the Green Houses,
With their girdles of spun gold,
And their long-sleeved dresses,
Coloured like the graining of wood.
As they walk,
The hems of their outer garments flutter
	open,
And the blood-red linings glow like sharp-
	toothed maple leaves
In Autumn.

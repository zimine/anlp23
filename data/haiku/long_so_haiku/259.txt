BALLS

Throw the blue ball above the little twigs
	of the tree-trops,
And cast the yellow ball straight at the 
	buzzing stars.

All our life is a flinging of coloured balls
	to impossible distances.
And in the end what have we?
	A tired arm - a tip-tilted nose.

Ah! Well! Give me the purple one.
Wouldn't it be a fine thing if I could
	make it stick
On top of the Methodist steeple?

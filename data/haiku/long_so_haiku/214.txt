THE SIXTEENTH FLOOR

The noise of the city sounds below me.
It clashes against the houses
And rises like smoke through the narrow
	streets.
It polishes the marble fronts of houses,
Grating itself against them,
And they shine in the lamplight
And cast their echoes back upon the
	asphalt of the streets.

But I hear no sound of your voice,
The city is incoherent - trivial,
And my brain aches with emptiness.

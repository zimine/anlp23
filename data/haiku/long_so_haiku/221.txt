NOVEMBER

The vine leaves against the brick walls of
	my house
Are rusty and broken.
Dead leaves gather under the pine-trees,
The brittle boughs of lilac-bushes
Sweep against the stars.
And I sit under a lamp
Trying to write down the emptiness of
	my heart.
Even the cat will not stay with men,
But prefers the rain
Under the meagre shelter of a cellar win-
	dow.

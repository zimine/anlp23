AUTUMNAL EQUINOX

Why do you not sleep, Beloved?

It is so cold that the stars stand out of
	the sky
Like the golden nails not driven home.
The fire crackles pleasantly,
And I sit here listening
For your regular breathing from the room
	above.

What keeps you awake, Beloved?
Is it the same nightmare that keeps me
	strained with listening
So that I cannot read?

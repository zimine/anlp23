A POET'S PROTEST

The printer and his binder,
	The printer's devil too,
And all except the poor contrib! - 
	What can the devil do?

The office must be paid for,
	The added price of coal;
And everything keeps going up
	Except the poet's dole!

And still he sings, though hunger
	Should make his stomach squirm.
What bird could sing so loud a note,
	With such a slender worm?

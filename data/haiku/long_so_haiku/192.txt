WHEAT-IN-THE-EAR

You stand between the cedars and the
	green spruces,
Brilliantly naked
And I think:
	What are you,
	A gem under sunlight?
	A poised spear?
	A jade cup?
You flash in front of the cedars and the
	tall spruces,
And I see that you are fire - 
Sacrificial fire on a jade altar,
Spear-tongue of white ceremonial fire.
My eyes burn,
My hands are flames seeking you,
But you are as remote from me as a 
	bright pointed planet
Set in the distance of an evening sky.

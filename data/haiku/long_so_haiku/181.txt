A POET'S WIFE

You have taken our love and turned it
	into coins of silver.
You sell the love poems you wrote for
	me,
And with the price of them you buy
	many cups of wine,
I beg that you remain dumb,
That you write no more poems.
For the wine does us both an injury,
And the words of your heart
Have become the common speech of the 
	Emperor's concubines.

JULY MIDNIGHT

Fireflies flicker in the tops of trees,
Flicker in the lower branches,
Skim along the ground.
Over the moon-white lilies
Is a flashing and ceasing of small, lemon-
	green stars.
As you lean against me,
Moon-white,
The air all about you
Is slit, and pricked, and pointed with
	sparkles of lemon-green flame
Starting out of a background of vague,
	blue trees.

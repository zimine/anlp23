TREES

The branches of the trees lie in layers
Above and behind each other,
And the sun strikes on the outstanding
	leaves
And turns them white,
And they dance like a spatter of pebbles
Against a green wall.

The trees make a solid path leading up
	in the air.
It looks as though I could walk upon it
If I only had courage to step out of the
	window.

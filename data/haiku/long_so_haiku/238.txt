THE CORNER OF NIGHT AND MORNING

Crows are cawing over pine-trees,
They are teaching their young to fly
Above the tall pyramids of double cher-
	ries.
Rose lustre over black lacquer - 
The feathers of the young birds reflect
	the rose-rising sun.
Caw! Caw! I want to go to sleep,
But perhaps it is better to stand in the
	window
And watch the crows teaching their
	young to fly
Over the pines and the pyramidal cherries,
In the rose-gold light
Of five o'clock on a May morning.

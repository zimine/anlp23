VERNAL EQUINOX

The scent of hyacinths, like a pale mist,
	lies between me and my book;
And the South Wind, washing through
	the room,
Makes the candles quiver.
My nerves sting at a spatter of rain on
	the shutter,
And I am uneasy with the thrusting of
	green shoots
Outside, in the night.
Why are you not here to overpower me,
	with your tense and urgent love?

EUCHARIS AMAZONICA

Wax-white lilies
	shaped like narcissus,
Frozen snow-rockets
	burst from a thin green stem,
Your trumpets spray antennae
	like cold, sweet notes stabbing air.
In your cups
	is the sharpness of winds,
The white husks of your blooms
	crack as ice cracks.
You strike against the darkness
	as hoar-frost patterning a window.

Wax-white lilies,
Eucharis lilies,
Mary kissed your petals,
And the chill of pure snow
Burned her lips with its six-pointed seal.

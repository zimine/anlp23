SPRING LONGING

The South wind blows open the folds
	of my dress,
My feet leave wet tracks in the earth
	of my garden,
The willows along the canal sing
	with new leaves turned upon the
	wind.
	I walk along the tow-path
	Gazing at the level water.
	Should I see a ribbed edge
	Running upon its clearness,
	I should know that this was caused
	By the prow of the boat
	In which you are to return.

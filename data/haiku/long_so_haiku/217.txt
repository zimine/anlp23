GROTESQUE

Why do the lilies goggle their tongues at
	me
When I pluck them;
And writhe, and twist,
And strangle themselves against my
	fingers,
So that I can hardly weave the garland
For your hair?
Why do they shriek your name
And spit at me
When I would cluster them?
Must I kill them
To make them lie still,
And send you a wreath of lolling corpses
To turn putrid and soft
On your forehead
While you dance?

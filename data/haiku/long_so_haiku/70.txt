HIDDEN BUILDERS

I built for myself an abode that was planned of materials
	only,
Carefully choosing each hollow bamboo;
But spirit-things also wove themselves into it, twining like
	tendrils through lattices,
Distilling their atmospheres finer than air, not fashioned for
	breathing;
Unseen and unguessed by the workmen, they too were the 
	builders and weavers,
Endlessly weaving.

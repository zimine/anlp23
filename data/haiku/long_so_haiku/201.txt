APRIL

A bird chirped at my window this morn-
	ing,
And over the sky is drawn a light net-
	work of clouds.
Come,
Let us go out into the open,
For my heart leaps like a fish that is
	ready to spawn.

I will lie under the beech-trees,
Under the grey branches of the beech-
	trees,
In a blueness of little squills and crocuses.
I will lie among the little squills
And be delivered of this overcharge of
	beauty,
And that which is born shall be a joy to
	you
Who love me.

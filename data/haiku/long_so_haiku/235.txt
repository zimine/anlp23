GOOD GRACIOUS!

They say there is a fairy in every streak'd
	tulip.
I have rows and rows of them beside my
	door.
Hoop-la! Come out, Brownie,
And I will give you an emerald ear-ring!
You had better come out,
For to-morrow may be stormy,
And I could never bring myself to part
	with my emerald ear-rings
Unless there was a moon.

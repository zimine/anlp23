HOARDED LOVE

House I have loved with a love like that of a man for a
	woman,
Love like an ether now clasps and folds you!
House I have blessed with a blessing like that of father for
	daughter,
Back from your walls, as I gazed open-eyed at the midnight,
Blessings returned like the voices persistent of temple bells
	ringing,
Clearer than silver!

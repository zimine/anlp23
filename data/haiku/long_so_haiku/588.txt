I sit by a charcoal brazier;
Silence in the wind without calms my thought.

I ask myself if the fire is not my own self.
What are the fire-sticks that mock, cheat, play
	with and stir my soul?
Oh, fire-sticks of my imagination, handle it kind,
It will soon pass away, like the fire, into dust,
	the silence.

A SPRIG OF ROSEMARY

I cannot see your face.
When I think of you,
It is your hands which I see.
Your hands
Sewing,
Holding a book,
Resting for a moment on the sill of a 
	window.
My eyes keep always the sight of your
	hands,
But my heart holds the sound of your voice,
And the soft brightness which is your soul.

LETTER WRITTEN FROM PRISON
BY TWO POLITICAL OFFENDERS

When a hero fails of his purpose,
His acts are regarded as those of a vil-
	lain and a robber.
Pursuing liberty, suddenly our plans are
	defeated.
In public we have been seized and pin-
	ioned and caged for many days.
How can we find exit from this place?
Weeping, we seem as fools; laughing, as
	rogues.
Alas! for us; we can only be silent.

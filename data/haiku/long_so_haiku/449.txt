LOVE'S ISLAND

An island in an inland sea;
	"Too small for me!" I sadly cried
	And then espied
A lark that rose into the sky.
Whereat I changed my plaintive cry:
	"If lark there be
	Then field there is.
	If field there be
	Then man there is.
	If man there be
	Then Love there is.
Then large enough, indeed, for me
Thou little island in the sea!"

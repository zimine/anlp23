NOSTALGIA

"Through pleasures and palaces" - 
Through hotels, and Pullman cars, and 
	steamships...

Pink and white camellias
		floating in a crystal bowl,
The sharp smell of firewood,
The scrape and rustle of a dog stretching
	himself
		on a hardwood floor,
And your voice, reading - reading - 
		to the slow ticking of an old brass
		clock...

"Tickets, please!"
And I watch the man in front of me
Fumbling in fourteen pockets,
While the conductor balances his ticket-
	punch
Between his fingers.

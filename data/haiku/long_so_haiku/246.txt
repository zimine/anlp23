TREES IN WINTER

PINE-TREES:
	Black clouds slowly swaying
	Over a white earth.

HEMLOCKS:
	Coned green shadows
	Through a falling veil.

ELM-TREES:
	Stiff black threads
	Lacing over silver.

CEDAR:
	Layered undulations
	Roofing naked ground.

ALMONDS:
	Flaring needles
	Stabbing at a grey sky.

WEEPING CHERRIES:
	Tossing smoke
	Swept down by wind.

OAKS:
	Twisted beams
	Cased in alabaster.

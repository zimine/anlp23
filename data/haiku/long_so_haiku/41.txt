MY SISTER

Across the meadow
The breeze is fragrant;
In a tree a bird
Disturbs the petals
Over these tombstones, still and content.

A melodious afternoon, years ago;
My sister
With pig-tail flying
Chased a dragon-fly
And laughed over nothing.

The clear vision stands today - 
When I pledged 
Tidings and gifts
Her strained lips quivered in vain - 
Before me, the tombstone, still and content.

The chirp of a bird among the trees - 
It too has died away.

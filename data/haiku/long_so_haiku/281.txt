MISERICORDIA

He earned his bread by making wooden
	soldiers,
With beautiful golden instruments,
Riding dapple-grey horses.
But when he heard the fanfare of trum-
	pets
And the long rattle of drums
As the army marched out of the city,
He took all his soldiers
And burned them in the grate;
And that night he fashioned a ballet-
	dancer
Out of tinted tissue paper,
And the next day he started to carve a
	Pieta
On the steel hilt
Of a cavalry sword.

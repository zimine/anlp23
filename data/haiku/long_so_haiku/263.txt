GENERATIONS

You are like the stem
Of a young beech-tree,
Straight and swaying,
Breaking out in golden leaves.
Your walk is like the blowing of a beech-
	tree
On a hill.
Your voice is like leaves
Softly struck upon by a South wind.
Your shadow is no shadow, but a scat-
	tered sunshine;
And at night you pull the sky down to
	you
And hood yourself in stars.

But I am like a great oak under a cloudy
	sky,
Watching a stripling beech grow up at
	my feet.

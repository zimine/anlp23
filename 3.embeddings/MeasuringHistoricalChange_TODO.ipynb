That is, let $\\mathcal{N}_{guten}(\\textrm{awesome})$ be the 50 nearest neighbors for the word \"awesome\" in the Gutenberg embeddings and $\\mathcal{N}_{wiki}(\\textrm{awesome})$ be the 50 nearest neighbors for \"awesome\" in the Wikipedia embeddings.  Calculate the size of $\\mathcal{N}_{guten}(\\textrm{awesome}) \\cap \\mathcal{N}_{wiki}(\\textrm{awesome})$.  Under this method, the words that share the *fewest* neighbors have moved the furthest apart.  Display the 100 words that have moved the furthest apart and the 100 words that have remained the closest together, along with their intersection score.  "

Rank all terms by the overlap score you created above, so that words with scores closer to 0 (i.e., no overlap in nearest neighbors) are ranked higher (i.e., closer to position 1). Measure how good your guesses were by calculating their [mean reciprocal rank](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mean_reciprocal_rank) within this list.

    "The accuracy overall is quite high. However, I'm a bit surprised that the universal POS tags do not have one tag for auxiliary verbs; verbs like `do` are tagged the same way as any other verbs, with one of the `VB` tags. The most approprite one, in my opinion, might be `Modal`. The spaCy tagger cannot identify noun-noun compound, for instance, the noun phrase `pod bay doors` are tagged as `NNP NNP NNS`, both `pod` and `bay` are tagged as singular proper noun instead of noun. One thing my classmate and I debated is verbs in imperative mood, for instance, `open` in the first sentence. We think it should be tagged as `VB` -- verb in base form instead of `VBP` -- verb in present tense. One thing we do agree with the spaCy tagger is `Force` in `May the Force be with you`, more likely to be tagged with `NNP` -- proper noun than noun. "

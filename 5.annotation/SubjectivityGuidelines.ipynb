    "At first I'm very much inclined to label this statement `subjective`, because it does include descriptive terms such as `light`, `fluffy`, and `lemon`, which are all personal experiences. It is confusing though, because the description could be true and widely accepted, which would make it more objective than it sounds. \n",
    "\n",
    "- This was the hardest test John had taken in a long time.\n",
    "\n",
    "This statement is different from `This is the saddest story I have ever heard`, which is clearly subjective as it's one's personal judgement of a movie. However, this statement is more about describing John's situation as taking a very hard test rather than making a direct assessment of the test's difficulty. In this sense, it could be seen as leaning more towards an objective description of the circumstances.\n",

This does not mean that the number of the movies made by actor-turned-directors couldn't happen to the same as someone's count. It seems that as long as the statement provides a verified argument, it could be objective. \n",

    "\n",
    "This statement is very deceptive as it has conditions such as `when used for` and `a tendency to`, which limit the areas where the argument `LLMs invent facts` could apply. It may sound very objective at first. On second thought, given that the statement is referring a rapidly-changing area of research, the truth value of whether LLMs are facts inventors changes everyday, depending on the task and model people use to generate the text. In a case where the truth value is uncertain, I'm inclined to say it is more subjective. \n",

    "- The traffic on I-80 west is pretty bad right now.\n",
    "\n",
    "This statement is analogous to the first and third statements in this category. It may sound very subjective but we don't know if the situation described is 1) widely accepted or 2) true. If so, the statement should be an objective one.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "In general, it feels to me that these statements are ambiguous to judge because it does not provide enough verifiable details for readers to assess the truth value, or the truth value is itself uncertain at the moment. Some statements may have very different results based on the annotator's knowledge, for example, someone who doesn't have any driving experience on I-80 may tend to say the statement is subjective but an experienced driver may tend to say it is objective. In addition to knowledge, the annotator's sentiment towards the object/situation described in the statement may also influence their interpretation of statements. That said, variation we see from annotators is very valuable for us to include in a classification model, or a place for us to think about when interpretating the results of a classifier."
